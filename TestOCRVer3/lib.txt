The basic idea of domain testing | to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain
to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain | called domain analysis, or input domain analysis
There are several important characteristics for this testing technique | It tests  UO  (inputloutput) relations by providing input values associated with all the individual input variables.The output variable values are not explicitly specified.  But, we assume that there are ways to check if the expected output is obtained for any given input.
The input domain consists of all the points representing  all the allowable | input com-binations  specified for the program  in the product specification. 
An input sub-domain is a subset of the input domain.  In general,  a sub-domain can be defined by a set of inequalities  in the form of | f(x1,x2,...xn)< K ,
A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains | A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains
A boundary  is where  two sub-domains meet.  When inequalities  are used  to define sub-domains as above, the following equation would give us a specific boundary: |  f(x1,x2,...xn) = K ,
A boundary is a linear boundary if  it is defined by | a1x1+ a2x2+...+anxn = K 
 If a sub-domain whose boundaries  are all  linear  one |  it  is called  a linear sub-domain
A point on a boundary  is called | a boundary point
if all the boundary points belong to the sub-domain | A boundary  is a closed one with respect to a specific sub-domain
if  none of  the boundary  points belong to the sub-domain | A  boundary  is  an  open one  with  respect  to  a  specific  sub-domain
the specific variations  of domain testing depend on | how this third step is carried out
The simplest strategy is | to sample one test  point  from inside each sub-domain in  the partition,  thus  achieving complete coverage of  all  the  sub-domains
Most of such cases indicate problems in the product pecification or in the implementation | which result in different output for the same input or  the system behaves incorrectly 
The most common situations for this kind of problems to occur is | when computational procedures  are defined for individual sub-domains
the problem with whether the boundary points belong to this sub-domain under consideration | Closureproblem
 problem refers to the disagreement with where exactly a boundary is between the intended and the actual boundary | Boundary shift
If a  boundary  is missing, that means the two neighboring sub-domains will collapse into one subdomain | Missing  boundary
Extreme-point combination |  one of the oldest domain testing strategies that are still used by people and supported by some testing tools
uses n ON points and  1  OFF points  to be defined below for each boundary | Weak N  X  1 strategy
In an n-dimensional space, a boundary defined by an equation in the form of  | f(x~,xi!, *. .yxn) = K 
If  the  boundary  is  a  closed  boundary with  respect  to  the  sub-domain under consideration | the OFF point will be outside the sub-domain or be an exterior point. 
If  the boundary  is  an  open  boundary  with  respect  to  the  sub-domain  under consideration | the OFF point  will  be  inside the sub-domain or be an  interior point
An extra boundary would likely  | to cause some of these IN points to receive different processing if  it separates them  apart
in  the two-dimensional space, it should be chosen by | Choosing the midpoint between the two ON points, Then  moving  6  distance off  the  boundary,  outward  or  inward  for 
boundary problems are considered below | Extra boundaly,Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
With extra boundary, more ON points would enhance the possibility that the extra boundary  | Extra boundaly
When boundary tilt or general boundary change  is concerned | Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
For nonlinear boundaries | n points are not enough to define the boundary
Other types of  boundaries and extensions  | Limits or boundaries associated ,The ideas  can be  used  for capacity  testing

The basic  idea of  FSMs |  use an  intermediate formalism to  model the program exe-cution or behavior that strikes

Input problems | In FSM-based testihg,  we typically treat
construct FSMs and validate them in the following steps | 1.Information source ,2.Construction of initial FSMs
State identification and enumeration | We need to keep the number of states to a manageable level
Transition identification with the help of input values | For each state, we can consider all the possible transitions in connection with
The basic  idea for identifying missing states or transitions is | similar to checklist- and partition-based testing. For example, a checklist based on produ
Checking for extra states and transitions can follow | essentially the same procedure by cross-validating them  with  the information sources
In  trying to reach a specific state, each test case is | essentially a series of  input values that enables us to make
From the current state, the next state to visit | determined by the input. 
Test case sensitization for FSM-based testing is | fairly easy and straightforward
Since each transition is | associated with specific input values, we can simply select such input values to sensitize the test case.
 FSM-modeled systems | input and output are associated with individual transitions instead of as an indistinguishable lump of  initial input for many other systems
FSM-based testing  | generally  suitable for systems with  clearly identifiable  states and state transitions.
FSM-based testing has |  received significant attention is the testing of object-oriented  software and systems
The primary  limitation  of FSM-based  testing is | its  inability to handle large number of states.

the DDGs typically show the following characteristics | here is usually one output data item,There are typically more input variables and constants,Multiple inlinks are common,Since the DDG is typically shown

Quality planning. These are the activities that should be carried out before carrying out the regular QA activities | Pre-QA activities
There are two major types of pre-QA activities in quality planning | Set specific quality goals && Form an overall QA strategy, which includes two sub-activities
Executing planned QA activities and handling discovered defects. In addition to performing selected QA activities, an important part of this normal execution is to deal with the discovered problems | In-QA activities
Quality measurement, assessment and improvement These are the activities that are carried out after normal QA activities have started but not as part of these normal activities. The primary purpose of these activities is to provide quality assessment and feedback so that various management decisions can be made and possible quality improvement initiatives can be carried out. | Post-QA activities

...can be defined as the probability of a software system to perform its specified functions correctly over a long period of time or for different input sets under the usage environments similar to that of its target customers|reliability

This model also includes a predictive element, enabling the user of this model to estimate model parameters from product and process characteristics even before actual failures are|observed
can be estimated by the slope ofthe fitted SRGMs, and overall reliability change (or reliability growth due to failure observations and fault removals) can be characterized by the slope change from the beginning of testing to the current time|Using SRGMs, product reliability at a given time
Test run data over time can be easily collected (Section 22.6), consistently used to track testing progress, and can lead to accurate reliability assessments with SRGMs if runs are homogeneous|Many uses oftest run counts
For large software systems studied here, becausemany test runs involve little execution and much setup and manual operations, SRGMs fitted to execution time data do not perform well|Limited applicability of execution time
When run homogeneity cannot be assured, detailed usage measurements, such as measured by transactions, can be used effectively for reliability analyses with SRGMs|Using transactions
These results and related studies of other products or systems (Tian et al., 1995; Tian, 1995; Tian and Palma, 1997; Tian et al., 2004) point to several important conclusions, including|Many uses oftest run counts,Limited applicability of execution time,Using transactions

First, we need to establisha predictive relationship between project metrics and actual product defects based on historical data|identification is to use predictive modeling to focus on the high-risk areas
this established predictive relation is used to predict potential defects for the new project or new product release once the project metrics data become available, but before actual defects are observed in the new project or product release|identification is to use predictive modeling to focus on the high-risk areas

of the analysis technique has many ramifications. A simple technique is generally easy to understand, easy to use, easy (and lesscostly) to performon a given set of data, and is more likely to be supported by existing tools|Simplicity
plays an important role in model applications. A good understanding of the analysis results is a precondition to follow-up actions|Ease of result interpretation
also has a significant influence on the practical applications of specific techniques|Availability of tool support
the questionsasked during the analyses are similar|What?,Where?,When?,Pre- or post-release?,How and Why?
The identification and classification of the discovered defects can be performed to identify what they are and classify them by some consistent scheme. This topic is the focus of this chapter, which is discussed in all subsequent sections|What?
Where was the defect found or discovered? This information can be used to provide valuable feedback to the development process through defect distribution analysis|Where?
The identificationof the exact time or associated development phase or subphase when a defect is injected and when it is discovered is important, because it provides information to analyze the overall defect trend and serves as the basis for quality prediction into the future|When?
An important extension to the “when” question is whether a defect is a pre-release defect or a post-release defect, sometimes labeled as an indevelopment(or in-process)or an in-field defect, respectively|Pre- or post-release?
How was the defect injected into the software,and why? These two questions are closely related, both pertaining to the cause of the discovered defects|How and Why?

If the information about defect injection time is available,it can be used to augmentthe defect removal models into the so called|defect dynamics model
Defect causal analysis can usually take two forms|logical analysis and statistical analysis.
a deterministic analysis that examinesthe logical link between the effects and the corresponding causes, and establishes general causal relations|Logical analysis
a probabilistic analysis that examines the statistical link between causes and effects and deduces the probable causal relations between the two|Statistical analysis
can be either the observed failures or discovered (or fixed) faults, and the corresponding causes are the faults that caused the failures or the errors that caused the injection of the faults, respectively|The effects in the defect causal analysis

can help us obtain an objective assessment of our current product quality, in contrast to the often unreliable subjective assessment based on personal judgment or imprecise qualitative assessment|MODELS FOR QUALITY ASSESSMENT
We define quality assessment models as analytical models that provide quantitative assessment of selected quality characteristics or sub-characteristics based on|measurement data from software projects
the correctness aspect of quality can be measured and derived ___ from its definitions|directly
we also need to monitor these ____ quality measurements and analyze them using various quality assessment models, so that we can assure and improve quality by controlling these indirect entities, particularly in the early part of software development process|indirect
Depending on whether product-specific measurements and results are used and provided, we can classify existing quality assessment models into two broad categories|generalized models and product-speciJicmodels 
compared by looking at their ability to provide useful information, their applicability to different project environments, and their inter-connections|Different types of quality assessment models and their relations
_____of the modeling results, in terms of how _____ the quality estimates
are and the _______ of the models to different environments.|Usefulness,accurate,applicability
Model inter-connections,which can be examined in two opposite directions|Customizution,Generalization
of generalized quality models to provide better quality estimates when product-specific information is available.|Customizution
of product-specific models when enough empirical evidence from different products or projects is accumulated.|Generalization
Decisions without explicit quality assessment|Implicit,Indirect,Otherfactors
such as completion of planned test activities, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly assumes the effectiveness of the testing activities|Implicit quality assessments
such as achieving certain test coverage goals, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly equates coverage levels to reliability levels.|Indirect quality assessments
such asproject schedule, cost, and resource utilization, can sometimes be used as exit criteria.|Otherfactors
Decisions based on explicit quality assessments|Failure-related, Fault-related
from a customer’sor external perspective, such as various reliability measures and impact assessments|Failure-related quality assessments
from a developer’s or internal perspective,such as defect density and count estimates for latent defects.|Fault-related quality assessments  
This decision is probably the one most closely identified with product release or phasehb-phase termination decisions. When there is a mismatch between a product’s quality progress and project schedule, adjustment is called for. The quality assessment results typically will indicate when the quality goal will be satisfied. This input can be used to delay (more often) or speed up (less often) the project schedule.|Schedule adjustment
Similar to the above, if a project is behind schedule or ahead of schedule, resource allocation decisions may be made to try to compensate for it by adding or removing certain resources, although the impact of this is limited (Brooks, 1995). | Resource allocation and adjustment
Sometimes, product release decisions are made regardless of the current quality level.|Planning for post-release product support
can be based on an assessment of quality strength and weakness of the current product, or a comparison between this and othercompetitive products| Planning forfuture products 
The follow-upand improvement can be concentratedin three major areas|Futureproduct, Process,people quality improvement
This is similar to the above feedbackand followup activities,but with the added hindsight. Better quality planning can be formulated based on the experience of the current project, both in terms of goal setting and the selectionof the overall QA strategies. |Futureproduct quality improvement 
This improvement can be achievedin two generalareas, the quality engineering process itself and the general software engineering process. The former can be based on the experience with carrying out the current quality engineering process, while the latter would also benefit greatly from alternativeexperience using other development processes to develop similar products|Processquality improvement
A more intangible benefit is the experience gained by
people in many areas, including domain knowledgeof the specific product, software process and technology experience, and quality engineering knowledge. Their experience can be packaged to ensure effective transfer of the collective knowledge and experience, or the so-called institutional memory, to new project personnel.|People quality improvement
the correctness aspect of quality can often be ____ derived from its definition or related to various defect measurements. |directly
To ensure proper collection and usage of various measurement data, we need to pay special attention to the following| Consistent interpretation and tracking,Timely defect and data reporting,Proper data granularity
For defects, we need to distinguish execution failures, internal faults, and errors in human actions. The specific problems need to be counted and tracked consistently. Similarly, other measurements also require us to maintain consistent interpretation.|Consistent interpretation and tracking
Because these measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely reporting of defects and other dynamic measurements to keep the information current.|Timely defect and data reporting
Different quality analyses and models might require data at different levels of granularity. We will examine this aspect further in connection with models for quality assessment and improvement in Chapter 19|Proper data granularity

being measured, including control (for example, control flow paths), data (for example, operand count), and presentation (for example,different indentation rules used).|Product (internal)attributes
Different attributes of the software artifacts may be treated as an unstructured heap of symbols (for example, raw count such as LOCline of code), or as syntactical structures (for example, various control flow path measurements (Fenton and Pfleeger, 1996)), or even as interconnected semantic entities (for example, context-sensitive measures such as live data definitions (Tai, 1984)).|Measurement of structures

activity measurements for the whole project. For example, total effort and cycle-time can be used in various models for overall quality assessment and project release decisions.|Coarse-grain

Functional (black-box) checklists at different levels of abstraction and granularity,| ranging from major high-level functions ...
Checklists of system elements (white-box) at different levels of granularity, | ranging from sub-systems and modules at the high level to individual 
Checklists about certain properties, such as coding standard, specific specification items, etc., which can be either black-box or white-box
A common way to obtain usable checklists is to | select items from several exhaustive checklists based on some criteria and to combine them
The most commonly used form of multiple checklists is | the hierarchical checklist
each item in a higher-level checklist expandable to a full checklist | at a lower level until we stop at a level of detail deemed enough by some criteria
One of the important characteristics of these checklists is that |they are typically not veryspecific, particularly those high-level ones
the increased demand for more automation, service, and functionality, modern software systems | also become larger and more complex
It would be hard to come up with checklists that cover all the functional (black-box) or structural (white-box) components| from different perspectives and at different levels
a lot of overlaps between different items in the checklists may be introduced, resulting in redundant testing effort when such checklists are used.
Some complex interactions of different system components or among major system functions are | hard or impossible to describe using checklists
this testing strategy directly corresponds to the checklist-based testing, with the domain partition as the checklist, and each sub-domain corresponding to a single element in the checklis
The subsets are mutually exclusive, that is,| no two subsets share any common member
The subsets are collectively exhaustive, that is, they collectively cover or include | all the elements in the original set
we simply select one item for testing at a time from the subset as a representative of the corresponding | equivalent class until we have exhausted all the subsets
if operations associated with one particular sub-domain are used more often than others, each underlying defect related to this sub-domain is also more likely to cause
The information related to usage scenarios, patterns, and related usage frequency| by target customers and users needs to be collected
Testing needs to be performed | in accordance with the OPs
Testing results can be analyzed to assess product reliability and provide feedback | to the testing and the general software development process
the actual testing is typically performed late in the overall product development process,| and the model construction could be and should be started much earlier
the operational profiles (OPs) need to be | constructed with customer and user input
testing according to customer usage scenarios and frequencies captured in OPs cannot be | performed until most of the product components have been implemented
each operation corresponds to an individual sub-domain | in domain partitions, thus representing a whole equivalence class
It is customary to sort the operations by descending | probabilities of usage and present the results in that order
It is common to have quite uneven distribution of usage probabilities, with a | few frequently used ones account for most of the usage frequencies
if some operations have very low probability of usage,| we could omit them in the OP
it can be used to support statistical testing by some random sampling procedure to | select test cases according to the probability distribution and execute them
each operation in the OP corresponds to certain test cases specifically constructed or| selected from existing ones to specifically test this system operation
Productivity improvement and schedule gains could be achieved because of | the focus on high-leverage parts with the use of OPs
Introducing new products by implementing highly used features quickly to capture market share | and then gradually adding lesser-used features in subsequent releases or product updates
The use of OPs can foster better communications with | target customers and help establish and maintain better customer relations
The use of OPs can help develop more precise product requirements and specifications, | which are more likely to satisfy customers’ needs
Customer and user training can be better focused on those features that the customers | use the most instead of esoteric ones more likely to be used by internal users
The exact way used to handle defects is also influenced by | the specific QA activities that led to their initial discovery, the project environment, and other factors
The most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution, which ensures that each discovered defect is |corrected or taken care of through appropriate actions.
Each corrected or fixed defect needs to be re-verified to ensure failure-free executions | under the same execution conditions
Defect logging | or the initial reporting and recording of a discovered defect This  ensures that a record will be kept for every discovered defect
Defect tracking | which monitors and records what happened to each defect after its initial discovery, up until its final resolution
Consistent defect interpretation and tracking | We need to distinguish execution failures,internal faults, and human errors. The specific problems need to be counted andtracked consistently
Timely defect reporting | Because defect measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely defect reporting to keep the information current
The exception is | unit testing, which is usually carried out parallel to coding by the same person
Most defects from unit testing are not | formally tracked because they are considered as part of the implementation activities
Defect handling is implicitly assumed to be part of the project  | management activities, which is handled in similar ways as configuration management.
A formalized defect handling process highlights important | activities and associated rules,parties involved, and their responsibilities. 
It is typically defined by the differentstates |  associated with individual defect status and transitions among these states due to status changes
Different defect handling processes may include | different collections of defect status and other possible attributes.
Defect handling is not closely associated with |  defect prevention.
The focus is not on the discovery of underlying faults that cause | failures and possible accidents
Defect information can be used | as additional input
Among the different QA activities, defect containment activities play | an important role in post-release product operations and maintenance support
Repeated use of recovery blocks for the same situations may be an | indication of software problems instead of 
Most of the implementation activities need to be carried out | during software development, not after product release...

A typical sequence includes, in chronological order: | product planning, requirement analysis,specification, design, coding, testing, release...
The error sources are typically associated with activities in these early phases, such as  | conceptual mistakes by designers and programmers,unfamiliarity with the product domain...
The vast majority of faults are  | injected in the early development phases, particularly in detailed design and implementation phases
failure prevention and containment activities, such as fault tolerance and safety assurance, | are typically the focus of operational phases
QA activities, typically inspections and reviews, carried out at the transitions | from one phase to the next are shown as barriers or gates to pass. 
The exception to this is between testing and release, where | the reviews are typically accompanied by acceptance testing
The general distribution scope is |shown by the dotted bracket, with a focus on defect prevention in the early phases, a focus on defect removal during coding and testing phases...
the overall process can be viewed as consisting of several | increments or iterations
integration testing plays a very important role, to make sure that | different parts can inter-operate seamlessly to fulfill the intended functionalities correctly together
System testing, where the focus is | the overall set of system functions to be provided to users
Usage-based statistical testing, where | the operational environment by target users is simulated during software testing before product release
Software fault tolerance, which focuses on | providing continued service expected by customers even when local problems exist
Software safety assurance activities, which focus on | providing the expected accidentfree operations or reducing accident damage when an accident is unavoidable
Software verification activities check | the conformance of a software system to its specifications
A deviation from the specification is either a fault or a failure, depending on | whether the behavior is specified or other software related entities are specific
failures are involved in verification activities, we are typically dealing with | internal system failures and overall system failures in the form of incorrect behavior
When a function or feature expected by the customers is present, the activity to determine | whether it performs or behaves expectedly is then a verification activity
When we are checking non-behavioral specifications, non-conformance indicates | the presence of faults or errors
Validation checks the conformance to quality expectations of customers and users in | the form of whether the expected functions or features are present or not
verification checks the conformance of software product implementation | against its specifications to see if it is implemented correctly
validation deals directly with users and their requirements  while | verification deals with internal product specifications
verification and validation activities may be distributed in | these different processes differently
A set of internal specifications needs to be | followed or other rules or criteria need to be satisfied
The satisfactory conformance of these specifications, designs, and rules is | the focus of various verification activities
various defect prevention activities are typically | concentrated in the earlier phases of software developmen
defect reduction is typically concentrated in | the middle to late phases of software developmen
defect containment activities are typically the focus of | operational phases, with its planning, design, and implementation carried out earlier during software development
Many specific QA activities deal with both |the verification and the validation aspects.
Defect prevention deals with error source elimination and error blocking, | while both verification and validation deal with failures and faults
The formal verification part naturally falls into verification activities, |verifying the program or design correctness with respect to its formal specifications 
fault tolerance and safety assurance, are more closely related to | validation activities than verification ...

"demonstration of proper behavior" is a primary purpose of testing|which can also be interpreted as providing evidence of quality in the context of software QA, or as meeting certain quality goals
testing fulfills two primarypurposes|to demonstrate quality or proper behavior, to detect and fix problems
the major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order|Testplanning andpreparation,Test execution, Analysis and follow-up
Testplanning and preparation|which set the goals for testing, select an overall testing strategy, and prepare specific test cases and the general test procedure
Test execution|and related activities, which also include related observation and measurement of product behavior
Analysis and follow-up, which include result checking and analysis to determine if a failure has been observed|and if so, follow-up activities are initiated and monitored to ensure removal of the underlying causes, or faults, that led to the observed failures in the first place
The major test activities are centered around test execution|performing the actual tests. At a minimum, testing involves executing the software and communicating the related
One of the key component to effective test execution is the handling of problems to 
ensure that failed runs will not block|the executions of other test cases. This is particularly important for systems that require continuous operation
defect fixing is not considered to be a part of testing|but rather a part of the development activities
re-verification of problem fixes is considered as a part of testing|In this book, we consider all of these activities as a part of testing
Data captured during execution and other related measurements can be|used to locate and fix the underlying faults that led to the observed failure
After we have determined if a test run is a success|or failure, appropriate actions can be initiated for failed runs to locate and fix the underlying faults
Test planning and preparation include the following sub-activities:Goal setting,Test case preparation, Test procedure preparation
there is a strong need for planned, monitored, managed and optimized  testing  strategies|based on1 systematic considerations for  quality, formal models, and related techniques
Test case preparation|It includes constructing new test cases or generating them automatically, selecting from existing ones for legacy products
Test procedure preparation|For systematic testing on a large scale for most of today’s software products and software- intensive systems
Test procedure preparation| a formal procedure is more of a necessity than a luxury, It can be defined and followed to ensure effective test execution, problem handling and resolution, and the overall test process management
What artifacts are tested?|The primary types of objects or software artifacts to be tested are software programs or code written in different programming languages
What artifacts are tested|Program code is the focus of our testing effort and related testing techniques and activities
What to test, and what kind of  faults is found?|Black-box (or functional) testing verifies the correct handling of the external functions provided or supported by the software, or whether the observed behavior conforms to user expectations or product specifications
What to test, and what kind of  faults is found|White-box (or structural) testing verifies the correct implementation of internal units, structures, and relations among them
When black-box testing is performed|failures related to specific external functions can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed
The emphasis is on reducing the chances of encountering|functional problems by target customers
when white-box testing is performed|ailures related to internal implementations can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed
When, or at what defect level, to stop testing?|Most of the traditional testing techniques and testing sub-phases use some coverage information as the stopping criterion
When, or at what defect level, to stop testing|with the implicit assumption that higher coverage means higher quality or lower levels of defects
What is the spec$c  testing technique used|what-to-test and stopping-criteria
There are two basic types of models|hose based on simple structures such as checklists and partitions,and those based on finite-state machines(FSMs).
Some specialized extensions to the two basic models can be used to support several commonly|used testing techniques, such as input domain testing that extends partition  ideas to input sub-domains and focuses on testing related boundary conditions and control flow and data flow testing (CFT & DFT)  that extends FSMs
Who performs which specific activities?|Different people may be involved in different roles
When can specific test activities be performed?|Because testing is an execution-based QA activity, a prerequisite to actual testing is the existence of the implemented software units
actual testing of large software systems is typically organized|and divided into various sub-phases starting from the coding phase up to post-release
What is the product type or market segment for the product under testing|Most of the testing techniques we describe are generally applicable to most application domains
The main difference between functional and structural testing is the perspective and the related focus|Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components
Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components|while viewing the object to be tested as a black-box that prevents us from seeing the contents inside
structural testing focus on the internal implementation|while viewing the object to be tested as a white-box that allows us to see the contents inside
actual testing for large software systems is typically organized and divided into|various sub-phases starting from the coding phase up to post-release product support, including unit testing, component testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, beta testing
Unit testing and component testing typically focus on|individual program elements that are present in the unit or component
Functional testing verifies the correct handling of the external functions provided by the|software, through the observation of the program external behavior during execution
Perspective|BBT  views the objects of  testing  as a black-box while focusing on testing the input-output relations or external functional behavior; while WBT views the objects as a glass-box where internal implementation details are visible and tested
Objects|WBT is generally used to test small objects, such as small software products or small units of large software products
Timeline|WBT is used more in early sub-phases of testing for large software systems, such as unit and component testing
Defect focus|In BBT, failures related to specific external functions can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed
Defect detection and fixing|Defects detected through WBT are easier to fix than those through BBT because of the direct connection between the observed failures and program units and implementation details in WBT
Techniques|Various techniques can be used to build models and generate test cases to perform systematic BBT
Resource-based criteria,The most commonly used such stopping criteria are|Stop when you run out of time.Stop when you run out of money
Activity-based criteria, commonly in the form|Stop when you complete planned test activities
Two primary types of usage models or OPs are|Flat OPs, or Musa OPs,Markov chain based usage models
Flat OPs, or Musa OPs|which present commonly used operations in a list, a histogram, or a tree-structure
Markov chain based usage models|which present commonly used operational units in Markov chains, where the state transition probabilities are history independent
The generic steps and major sub-activities for CBT model|Defining the model,Checking individual model elements,Dejning coverage criteria,Derive test cases
Defining the model|These models are often represented by some graphs, with individual  nodes representing the basic  model elements and links representing the interconnections
Checking individual model elements|to make sure the individual elements, such as links, nodes, and related properties, have been tested individually, typically in isolation
Defining coverage criteria|Besides covering the basic model elements above, some other coverage criteria are typically used to cover the overall execution and interactions
Derive test cases|Once the coverage criteria are defined, we can design our test cases to achieve them
Perspective: UBST views the objects of testing|from a user’s perspective and focuses 
on the usage scenarios, sequences, patterns, and associated frequencies or probabilities,while CBT views the objects from a developer’s 
Stopping criteria: UBST use product reliability|goals as the exit criterion; and CBT using coverage goals - surrogates or approximations of reliability goals
Usage-based vs. coverage-based stopping criteria and corresponding|testing techniques, with the former attempting to reach certain reliability goals by focusing on functions and feature frequently
Overall objectives and goals, which can be refined into specific|goals for specific testing. Some specific goals include reliability for usage-based statistical testing or coverage for various traditional testing techniques
Objects to be tested and the specific focus|Functional testing views the software product as a black-box and focuses on testing the external functional behavior
Information source identification and data collection| The information and data are generally affected by both what is required by specific models and what is available in the project environment
Analysis and initial model construction: The information|and data collected above are analyzed to construct testing models
Model validation and incremental improvement|This is an important step, particularly for large objects or for functions or usages associated with external customers
A test case|is a collection of entities and related information that allows a test to be executed or a test run to be performed
A test run|is a dynamic unit of specific test activities in the overall testing sequence on a selected testing object
Dependencies among individual test cases|Some test cases can only be run after others because one is used to set up another
Defect detection related sequencing|Many problems can only be effectively detected after others have been discovered and fixed
Sequences to  avoid accidents|For some systems,  possibly  severe problems and damages may incur during testing if certain areas were not checked through related test
Problem diagnosis related sequencing|Some execution problems observed during testing may involve complicated scenarios and many
Natural grouping of test cases|such as by functional and structural areas or by usage frequencies, can also be used for test sequencing and to manage parallel testing
General steps in test execution include|Allocating test time and resources,nvoking and running tests, and collecting execution information and measurements;Checking testing results and identifying system failures
Result checking, or the oracle problem|and the related failure identification is a difficult task, because of both the theoretical difficulties and practical limitations
Analysis of individual test runs includes|result checking and failure identification we covered in the previous section as part of the test execution activities
Problem diagnosis to examine|what kind of problem it is, where, when, and possible causes. This may involve analyzing the above records and using some diagnostic
Fault locating, to identify the exact location(s)|of fault(s) based on information from the previous steps and product knowledge
Defect Jixing, to fix the located fault(s) by adding|removing, or correcting certain parts of the code
Reliability  analysis for  usage-based testing|which can be used to assess  current product reliability and as input to determine if the pre-set reliability goal has been achieved
Coverage analysis for coverage-based testing|which can be used as a surrogate for reliability and used as the stopping criterion or as input to various decisions related to testing management
Overall  defect analysis|which can be used to examine defect distribution and to identify high-defect areas for focused remedial actions
vertical model would organize around a product|where dedicated people perform one or more testing tasks for the product.
horizontal model is used  in some large organizations|so that a testing team only performs one kind of testing for many different products within the organization
Various issues related to test automation include|specific needs and potential for autornation; selection of existing testing tools if available;possibility and cost of constructing specific test automation tools; availability of user training for these tools and time/effort needed;
McCabe Test from McCabe|and Associates provides control flow coverage related information and analysis. 
S-TCAT (System Test Coverage Analysis Tool) from SRI|provides function-level coverage and call-pair information
ATAC|from Telecodia is a data flow coverage analysis tool for white-box testing. 
Test planning and preparation|setting goal, sellecting overall strategies and techniques gathering information constructing testing modelspreparing individual test cases
Test execution and measurement|allocating and adjusting test time and resources,invoking and running tests, and taking appropriate measurements,checking testing results and identifying system failures.
Pre-QA activities| Quality planning:These are the activities that should be carried out before carrying out the regular QA activities
quantify these quality expectations to set appropriate quality goals in two steps|We need to select or define the quality measurements and models,We need to find out the expected values or ranges of the corresponding quality
The influence of quality perspectives and attributes|For different kinds of customers, users, and market segments, different QA alternatives might be appropriate
The influence of different quality Levels|Quantitative quality levels as specified in the quality goals may also affect the choice of appropriate QA techniques
Measurement: Besides defect measurements|collected during defect handling, which is typically carried out as part of the normal QA activities, various other measurements 
Analysis and modeling|These activities analyze measurement data from software projects and fit them  to analytical models that provide quantitative assessment of selected quality characteristics or sub-characteristics
Providing feedback and identifying improvement potentials|Results from the above analysis and modeling activities can provide feedback to the quality engineering process
Follow-up activities|Besides the immediate use of analysis and modeling results described above,various follow-up activities can be carried out to affect the long-term quality and organizational performance
The quality engineering process|forms an integral part of the overall software engineering process, where other concerns, such as cost and schedule, are also considered and managed
In alternative software processes other than waterfall|such as in incremental, iterative, spiral, and extreme programming processes
For normal project monitoring and management under any process|appropriate measurement activities need to be carried out to collect or extract data from the software process
Minor modifications|are needed to  integrate quality engineering activities into other development processes
Quality planning drives|and should precede the other two groups of activities
The collective effort of selected QA activities|generally demonstrated the following pattern|gradual build-up process for individual QA activities
Quality Planning before specific QA activities are carried out|in the so-called pre-QA activities in software quality engineering
Quality quantization|and improvement through measurement, analysis, feedback,and follow-up activities
the biggest obstacle to formal methods|is the high cost associated with the difficult task of performing these human intensive activities correctly without adequate automated support
The question of applicability can be answered in two steps|The type of products or application domains that would benefit,..The type of software artifacts in the above products
The most commonly verified or analyzed objects| are the program code
The basic reason behind this is the shared formalism and formal language|that can be used to describe, model, and analyze different type of systems, not just limited
In terms of the software artifacts from different development phases being verified and analyze| these techniques are closely related to and depend upon the availability of formal system specifications, either as formal descriptions
Formal verification and analysis|is most closely related  to formal inspection, review, and static analysis
formal methods belong to the defect prevention category|with formal specifications eliminating certain error sources due to poor understanding of product requirements and formal verification confirming the absence of certain defects.
The use of recovery blocks|occasional failures only cause loss of partial computational results but not complete execution failures
Periodic checkpointing and refreshing to save the dynamic contents of software executions|Sometimes this activity can be associated with the completion of some major tasks or occurrence of some significant events, in addition to at the pre-determinedtime instances
Failure detection|This activity is typically associated with the checkpointing activity above
before a new checkpoint can be established|some consistency check is carried out to see if there is an execution failure or other suspected
If a failure is detected|1. Rollback by restoring the saved dynamic contents2. Rerun the lost computation.
In using recovery blocks, failures are detected|but the underlying faults are not removed
The limited capability for fault tolerance is achieved through fault avoidance|due to different execution path or execution condition that does not involve the fault code
Another issue is the maintenance and follow-up activities to normal operations|repeated failures need to be dealt with by taking the system off-line for defect analysis and fixing
Analysis of actual or potential accident scenarios|with a focus on preconditions, or hazards, for these scenarios This type of analysis is called hazard analysis
Preventive and remedial actions for accident prevention|referred to as hazard resolution, to deal with the hazards identified in the above analysis
Generic ways include hazard elimination|hazard reduction, and hazard control. 
The basic analysis tool is logical diagrams called fault-trees|which also represent the analysis results
The analysis follows a top-down procedure|starting with the top event and recursively analyzing each event or condition to find out its logical conditions or sub-conditions
An event tree|is a temporal cause-effect diagram We start with the primary event and follow through its subsequent events and consequences over time or stages
Each branch of the event tree|represents a specific consequence of a decision, which in turn can be associated with their own subsequent decisions and consequences
The main usage of ETA is to recreate accident sequences and/or scenarios|the critical paths that lead from the primary events through a sequence of decisions
Hazard elimination through substitution|simplification, decoupling, elimination of specific human errors, and reduction of hazardous materials or conditions
Hazard reduction through design for controllability|use of locking devices and failure probability minimization using safety margins and redundancy
Hazard control|through reducing exposure, isolation and containment protection system
damage control|also involves accident analysis that guide planned and actual strategies for damage control in the unfortunate event that accidents do happen
Detection or observation|of specific problems from specific defect perspectives during the performance of specific QA activities
Types of follow-up actions|that deal with the observed or detected problems in specific ways as examined from the defect perspectives
Defect prevention|works  to block some errors or to remove error sources to prevent the injection of related faults
One key difference between inspection and testing|is the way faults are identified
Inspection involves static examination| while testing involves dynamic executions
It is hard for human inspectors to keep track of multiple components and complicated interactions over time|while the same task may not be such a difficult one for computers
Human inspectors can focus on a small area and perform|in-depth analysis, leading to effective detection of localized faults
Formal verification|deals with logical (or mathematical) correctness, and can be interpreted as extremely formalized inspection
Fault tolerance and failure|containment are designed to work with dynamic operational problems that may lead to global failures and accidents
For existing products with relatively high defect levels or with many common faults|inspection is most likely to be more effective than testing
A proof of correctness of a formal verification|can only be produced if the program is fault-free with respect to its formal specification
When verification cannot be successfully|further analysis can often reveal accidental logical or functional faults
Fault tolerance techniques|generally involve the observations of dynamic local failures failures and the tolerance of the related faults but not the identification and removal of these faults
Most traditional QA activities|such as testing and inspection, focus on defect detection and removal
Operational cost of having specific mechanisms|in the operational systems, which may slow down the overall system, reduce the system capacity, or negatively affect other performance measures
Implementation cost to design|implement, and ensure selected features and mechanisms, such as backups and redundancies
Failure or accident cost|which is similar to the dormant defect cost considered above for defect prevention and defect reduction techniques
Among the three, failure/accident|cost need to be balanced against the other two to justify  spending valuable resources to implement and operate these fault tolerance 
active design reviews (ADR) to ensure inspectors’ active participation, | the author prepares questionnaires to focus on specific scenarios or areas
these analyses can be used in testing or other QA activities |  Decision table and decision tree analyses,Boundary value analysis is related to testing,Finite-state machine analysis is most closely related,ontrol flow and data dependency analyses

The basic idea of domain testing | to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain
to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain | called domain analysis, or input domain analysis
There are several important characteristics for this testing technique | It tests  UO  (inputloutput) relations by providing input values associated with all the individual input variables.The output variable values are not explicitly specified.  But, we assume that there are ways to check if the expected output is obtained for any given input.
The input domain consists of all the points representing  all the allowable | input com-binations  specified for the program  in the product specification. 
An input sub-domain is a subset of the input domain.  In general,  a sub-domain can be defined by a set of inequalities  in the form of | f(x1,x2,...xn)< K ,
A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains | A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains
A boundary  is where  two sub-domains meet.  When inequalities  are used  to define sub-domains as above, the following equation would give us a specific boundary: |  f(x1,x2,...xn) = K ,
A boundary is a linear boundary if  it is defined by | a1x1+ a2x2+...+anxn = K 
 If a sub-domain whose boundaries  are all  linear  one |  it  is called  a linear sub-domain
A point on a boundary  is called | a boundary point
if all the boundary points belong to the sub-domain | A boundary  is a closed one with respect to a specific sub-domain
if  none of  the boundary  points belong to the sub-domain | A  boundary  is  an  open one  with  respect  to  a  specific  sub-domain
the specific variations  of domain testing depend on | how this third step is carried out
The simplest strategy is | to sample one test  point  from inside each sub-domain in  the partition,  thus  achieving complete coverage of  all  the  sub-domains
Most of such cases indicate problems in the product pecification or in the implementation | which result in different output for the same input or  the system behaves incorrectly 
The most common situations for this kind of problems to occur is | when computational procedures  are defined for individual sub-domains
the problem with whether the boundary points belong to this sub-domain under consideration | Closureproblem
 problem refers to the disagreement with where exactly a boundary is between the intended and the actual boundary | Boundary shift
If a  boundary  is missing, that means the two neighboring sub-domains will collapse into one subdomain | Missing  boundary
Extreme-point combination |  one of the oldest domain testing strategies that are still used by people and supported by some testing tools
uses n ON points and  1  OFF points  to be defined below for each boundary | Weak N  X  1 strategy
In an n-dimensional space, a boundary defined by an equation in the form of  | f(x~,xi!, *. .yxn) = K 
If  the  boundary  is  a  closed  boundary with  respect  to  the  sub-domain under consideration | the OFF point will be outside the sub-domain or be an exterior point. 
If  the boundary  is  an  open  boundary  with  respect  to  the  sub-domain  under consideration | the OFF point  will  be  inside the sub-domain or be an  interior point
An extra boundary would likely  | to cause some of these IN points to receive different processing if  it separates them  apart
in  the two-dimensional space, it should be chosen by | Choosing the midpoint between the two ON points, Then  moving  6  distance off  the  boundary,  outward  or  inward  for 
boundary problems are considered below | Extra boundaly,Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
With extra boundary, more ON points would enhance the possibility that the extra boundary  | Extra boundaly
When boundary tilt or general boundary change  is concerned | Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
For nonlinear boundaries | n points are not enough to define the boundary

The basic  idea of  FSMs |  use an  intermediate formalism to  model the program exe-cution or behavior that strikes

Input problems | In FSM-based testihg,  we typically treat
construct FSMs and validate them in the following steps | 1.Information source ,2.Construction of initial FSMs
State identification and enumeration | We need to keep the number of states to a manageable level
Transition identification with the help of input values | For each state, we can consider all the possible transitions in connection with
The basic  idea for identifying missing states or transitions is | similar to checklist- and partition-based testing. For example, a checklist based on produ
Checking for extra states and transitions can follow | essentially the same procedure by cross-validating them  with  the information sources
In  trying to reach a specific state, each test case is | essentially a series of  input values that enables us to make

Test case sensitization for FSM-based testing is | fairly easy and straightforward
Since each transition is | associated with specific input values, we can simply select such input values to sensitize the test case.
 FSM-modeled systems | input and output are associated with individual transitions instead of as an indistinguishable lump of  initial input for many other systems
FSM-based testing  | generally  suitable for systems with  clearly identifiable  states and state transitions.
FSM-based testing has |  received significant attention is the testing of object-oriented  software and systems
The primary  limitation  of FSM-based  testing is | its  inability to handle large number of states.

For DFT, test preparation includes the following steps: | Build and verify the DDGs>Define and  select data slices to cover>Sensitize the data slices or the test>Plan for result checking

the questionsasked during the analyses are similar|What?,Where?,When?,Pre- or post-release?,How and Why?
The identification and classification of the discovered defects can be performed to identify what they are and classify them by some consistent scheme. This topic is the focus of this chapter, which is discussed in all subsequent sections|What?

Decisions without explicit quality assessment|Implicit,Indirect,Otherfactors
such as completion of planned test activities, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly assumes the effectiveness of the testing activities|Implicit quality assessments
such as achieving certain test coverage goals, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly equates coverage levels to reliability levels.|Indirect quality assessments
such asproject schedule, cost, and resource utilization, can sometimes be used as exit criteria.|Otherfactors
Decisions based on explicit quality assessments|Failure-related, Fault-related
from a customer’sor external perspective, such as various reliability measures and impact assessments|Failure-related quality assessments
from a developer’s or internal perspective,such as defect density and count estimates for latent defects.|Fault-related quality assessments  
This decision is probably the one most closely identified with product release or phasehb-phase termination decisions. When there is a mismatch between a product’s quality progress and project schedule, adjustment is called for. The quality assessment results typically will indicate when the quality goal will be satisfied. This input can be used to delay (more often) or speed up (less often) the project schedule.|Schedule adjustment
Similar to the above, if a project is behind schedule or ahead of schedule, resource allocation decisions may be made to try to compensate for it by adding or removing certain resources, although the impact of this is limited (Brooks, 1995). | Resource allocation and adjustment
Sometimes, product release decisions are made regardless of the current quality level.|Planning for post-release product support
can be based on an assessment of quality strength and weakness of the current product, or a comparison between this and othercompetitive products| Planning forfuture products 
The follow-upand improvement can be concentratedin three major areas|Futureproduct, Process,people quality improvement
This is similar to the above feedbackand followup activities,but with the added hindsight. Better quality planning can be formulated based on the experience of the current project, both in terms of goal setting and the selectionof the overall QA strategies. |Futureproduct quality improvement 
This improvement can be achievedin two generalareas, the quality engineering process itself and the general software engineering process. The former can be based on the experience with carrying out the current quality engineering process, while the latter would also benefit greatly from alternativeexperience using other development processes to develop similar products|Processquality improvement
A more intangible benefit is the experience gained by
people in many areas, including domain knowledgeof the specific product, software process and technology experience, and quality engineering knowledge. Their experience can be packaged to ensure effective transfer of the collective knowledge and experience, or the so-called institutional memory, to new project personnel.|People quality improvement
the correctness aspect of quality can often be ____ derived from its definition or related to various defect measurements. |directly
To ensure proper collection and usage of various measurement data, we need to pay special attention to the following| Consistent interpretation and tracking,Timely defect and data reporting,Proper data granularity
For defects, we need to distinguish execution failures, internal faults, and errors in human actions. The specific problems need to be counted and tracked consistently. Similarly, other measurements also require us to maintain consistent interpretation.|Consistent interpretation and tracking
Because these measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely reporting of defects and other dynamic measurements to keep the information current.|Timely defect and data reporting
Different quality analyses and models might require data at different levels of granularity. We will examine this aspect further in connection with models for quality assessment and improvement in Chapter 19|Proper data granularity

being measured, including control (for example, control flow paths), data (for example, operand count), and presentation (for example,different indentation rules used).|Product (internal)attributes
Different attributes of the software artifacts may be treated as an unstructured heap of symbols (for example, raw count such as LOCline of code), or as syntactical structures (for example, various control flow path measurements (Fenton and Pfleeger, 1996)), or even as interconnected semantic entities (for example, context-sensitive measures such as live data definitions (Tai, 1984)).|Measurement of structures

Functional (black-box) checklists at different levels of abstraction and granularity,| ranging from major high-level functions ...
Checklists of system elements (white-box) at different levels of granularity, | ranging from sub-systems and modules at the high level to individual 
Checklists about certain properties, such as coding standard, specific specification items, etc., which can be either black-box or white-box
A common way to obtain usable checklists is to | select items from several exhaustive checklists based on some criteria and to combine them
The most commonly used form of multiple checklists is | the hierarchical checklist
each item in a higher-level checklist expandable to a full checklist | at a lower level until we stop at a level of detail deemed enough by some criteria
One of the important characteristics of these checklists is that |they are typically not veryspecific, particularly those high-level ones
the increased demand for more automation, service, and functionality, modern software systems | also become larger and more complex
It would be hard to come up with checklists that cover all the functional (black-box) or structural (white-box) components| from different perspectives and at different levels
a lot of overlaps between different items in the checklists may be introduced, resulting in redundant testing effort when such checklists are used.
Some complex interactions of different system components or among major system functions are | hard or impossible to describe using checklists
this testing strategy directly corresponds to the checklist-based testing, with the domain partition as the checklist, and each sub-domain corresponding to a single element in the checklis
The subsets are mutually exclusive, that is,| no two subsets share any common member
The subsets are collectively exhaustive, that is, they collectively cover or include | all the elements in the original set
we simply select one item for testing at a time from the subset as a representative of the corresponding | equivalent class until we have exhausted all the subsets
if operations associated with one particular sub-domain are used more often than others, each underlying defect related to this sub-domain is also more likely to cause
The information related to usage scenarios, patterns, and related usage frequency| by target customers and users needs to be collected
Testing needs to be performed | in accordance with the OPs
Testing results can be analyzed to assess product reliability and provide feedback | to the testing and the general software development process
the actual testing is typically performed late in the overall product development process,| and the model construction could be and should be started much earlier
the operational profiles (OPs) need to be | constructed with customer and user input
testing according to customer usage scenarios and frequencies captured in OPs cannot be | performed until most of the product components have been implemented
each operation corresponds to an individual sub-domain | in domain partitions, thus representing a whole equivalence class
It is customary to sort the operations by descending | probabilities of usage and present the results in that order
It is common to have quite uneven distribution of usage probabilities, with a | few frequently used ones account for most of the usage frequencies
if some operations have very low probability of usage,| we could omit them in the OP
it can be used to support statistical testing by some random sampling procedure to | select test cases according to the probability distribution and execute them
each operation in the OP corresponds to certain test cases specifically constructed or| selected from existing ones to specifically test this system operation
Productivity improvement and schedule gains could be achieved because of | the focus on high-leverage parts with the use of OPs
Introducing new products by implementing highly used features quickly to capture market share | and then gradually adding lesser-used features in subsequent releases or product updates
The use of OPs can foster better communications with | target customers and help establish and maintain better customer relations
The use of OPs can help develop more precise product requirements and specifications, | which are more likely to satisfy customers’ needs
Customer and user training can be better focused on those features that the customers | use the most instead of esoteric ones more likely to be used by internal users
The exact way used to handle defects is also influenced by | the specific QA activities that led to their initial discovery, the project environment, and other factors
The most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution, which ensures that each discovered defect is |corrected or taken care of through appropriate actions.
Each corrected or fixed defect needs to be re-verified to ensure failure-free executions | under the same execution conditions
Defect logging | or the initial reporting and recording of a discovered defect This  ensures that a record will be kept for every discovered defect
Defect tracking | which monitors and records what happened to each defect after its initial discovery, up until its final resolution
Consistent defect interpretation and tracking | We need to distinguish execution failures,internal faults, and human errors. The specific problems need to be counted andtracked consistently
Timely defect reporting | Because defect measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely defect reporting to keep the information current
The exception is | unit testing, which is usually carried out parallel to coding by the same person
Most defects from unit testing are not | formally tracked because they are considered as part of the implementation activities
Defect handling is implicitly assumed to be part of the project  | management activities, which is handled in similar ways as configuration management.
A formalized defect handling process highlights important | activities and associated rules,parties involved, and their responsibilities. 
It is typically defined by the differentstates |  associated with individual defect status and transitions among these states due to status changes
Different defect handling processes may include | different collections of defect status and other possible attributes.
Defect handling is not closely associated with |  defect prevention.
The focus is not on the discovery of underlying faults that cause | failures and possible accidents
Defect information can be used | as additional input
Among the different QA activities, defect containment activities play | an important role in post-release product operations and maintenance support
Repeated use of recovery blocks for the same situations may be an | indication of software problems instead of 
Most of the implementation activities need to be carried out | during software development, not after product release...
including defect prevention and defect reduction, are performed | during software development instead of during in-field software support after
A typical sequence includes, in chronological order: | product planning, requirement analysis,specification, design, coding, testing, release...
The error sources are typically associated with activities in these early phases, such as  | conceptual mistakes by designers and programmers,unfamiliarity with the product domain...
The vast majority of faults are  | injected in the early development phases, particularly in detailed design and implementation phases
failure prevention and containment activities, such as fault tolerance and safety assurance, | are typically the focus of operational phases
QA activities, typically inspections and reviews, carried out at the transitions | from one phase to the next are shown as barriers or gates to pass. 
The exception to this is between testing and release, where | the reviews are typically accompanied by acceptance testing
The general distribution scope is |shown by the dotted bracket, with a focus on defect prevention in the early phases, a focus on defect removal during coding and testing phases...
the overall process can be viewed as consisting of several | increments or iterations
integration testing plays a very important role, to make sure that | different parts can inter-operate seamlessly to fulfill the intended functionalities correctly together
System testing, where the focus is | the overall set of system functions to be provided to users
Usage-based statistical testing, where | the operational environment by target users is simulated during software testing before product release
Software fault tolerance, which focuses on | providing continued service expected by customers even when local problems exist
Software safety assurance activities, which focus on | providing the expected accidentfree operations or reducing accident damage when an accident is unavoidable
Software verification activities check | the conformance of a software system to its specifications
A deviation from the specification is either a fault or a failure, depending on | whether the behavior is specified or other software related entities are specific
failures are involved in verification activities, we are typically dealing with | internal system failures and overall system failures in the form of incorrect behavior
When a function or feature expected by the customers is present, the activity to determine | whether it performs or behaves expectedly is then a verification activity
When we are checking non-behavioral specifications, non-conformance indicates | the presence of faults or errors
Validation checks the conformance to quality expectations of customers and users in | the form of whether the expected functions or features are present or not
verification checks the conformance of software product implementation | against its specifications to see if it is implemented correctly
validation deals directly with users and their requirements  while | verification deals with internal product specifications
verification and validation activities may be distributed in | these different processes differently
A set of internal specifications needs to be | followed or other rules or criteria need to be satisfied
The satisfactory conformance of these specifications, designs, and rules is | the focus of various verification activities
various defect prevention activities are typically | concentrated in the earlier phases of software developmen
defect reduction is typically concentrated in | the middle to late phases of software developmen
defect containment activities are typically the focus of | operational phases, with its planning, design, and implementation carried out earlier during software development
Many specific QA activities deal with both |the verification and the validation aspects.
Defect prevention deals with error source elimination and error blocking, | while both verification and validation deal with failures and faults
The formal verification part naturally falls into verification activities, |verifying the program or design correctness with respect to its formal specifications 
fault tolerance and safety assurance, are more closely related to | validation activities than verification ...

"demonstration of proper behavior" is a primary purpose of testing|which can also be interpreted as providing evidence of quality in the context of software QA, or as meeting certain quality goals
testing fulfills two primarypurposes|to demonstrate quality or proper behavior, to detect and fix problems
the major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order|Testplanning andpreparation,Test execution, Analysis and follow-up
Testplanning and preparation|which set the goals for testing, select an overall testing strategy, and prepare specific test cases and the general test procedure
Test execution|and related activities, which also include related observation and measurement of product behavior
Analysis and follow-up, which include result checking and analysis to determine if a failure has been observed|and if so, follow-up activities are initiated and monitored to ensure removal of the underlying causes, or faults, that led to the observed failures in the first place
The major test activities are centered around test execution|performing the actual tests. At a minimum, testing involves executing the software and communicating the related
One of the key component to effective test execution is the handling of problems to 
ensure that failed runs will not block|the executions of other test cases. This is particularly important for systems that require continuous operation
defect fixing is not considered to be a part of testing|but rather a part of the development activities
re-verification of problem fixes is considered as a part of testing|In this book, we consider all of these activities as a part of testing
Data captured during execution and other related measurements can be|used to locate and fix the underlying faults that led to the observed failure
After we have determined if a test run is a success|or failure, appropriate actions can be initiated for failed runs to locate and fix the underlying faults
Test planning and preparation include the following sub-activities:Goal setting,Test case preparation, Test procedure preparation
there is a strong need for planned, monitored, managed and optimized  testing  strategies|based on1 systematic considerations for  quality, formal models, and related techniques
Test case preparation|It includes constructing new test cases or generating them automatically, selecting from existing ones for legacy products
Test procedure preparation|For systematic testing on a large scale for most of today’s software products and software- intensive systems

The main difference between functional and structural testing is the perspective and the related focus|Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components
Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components|while viewing the object to be tested as a black-box that prevents us from seeing the contents inside
structural testing focus on the internal implementation|while viewing the object to be tested as a white-box that allows us to see the contents inside
actual testing for large software systems is typically organized and divided into|various sub-phases starting from the coding phase up to post-release product support, including unit testing, component testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, beta testing
Unit testing and component testing typically focus on|individual program elements that are present in the unit or component
Functional testing verifies the correct handling of the external functions provided by the|software, through the observation of the program external behavior during execution
Perspective|BBT  views the objects of  testing  as a black-box while focusing on testing the input-output relations or external functional behavior; while WBT views the objects as a glass-box where internal implementation details are visible and tested
Objects|WBT is generally used to test small objects, such as small software products or small units of large software products
Timeline|WBT is used more in early sub-phases of testing for large software systems, such as unit and component testing
Defect focus|In BBT, failures related to specific external functions can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed
Defect detection and fixing|Defects detected through WBT are easier to fix than those through BBT because of the direct connection between the observed failures and program units and implementation details in WBT
Techniques|Various techniques can be used to build models and generate test cases to perform systematic BBT
Resource-based criteria,The most commonly used such stopping criteria are|Stop when you run out of time.Stop when you run out of money
Activity-based criteria, commonly in the form|Stop when you complete planned test activities
Two primary types of usage models or OPs are|Flat OPs, or Musa OPs,Markov chain based usage models
Flat OPs, or Musa OPs|which present commonly used operations in a list, a histogram, or a tree-structure
Markov chain based usage models|which present commonly used operational units in Markov chains, where the state transition probabilities are history independent
The generic steps and major sub-activities for CBT model|Defining the model,Checking individual model elements,Dejning coverage criteria,Derive test cases
Defining the model|These models are often represented by some graphs, with individual  nodes representing the basic  model elements and links representing the interconnections
Checking individual model elements|to make sure the individual elements, such as links, nodes, and related properties, have been tested individually, typically in isolation
Defining coverage criteria|Besides covering the basic model elements above, some other coverage criteria are typically used to cover the overall execution and interactions
Derive test cases|Once the coverage criteria are defined, we can design our test cases to achieve them
Perspective: UBST views the objects of testing|from a user’s perspective and focuses 
on the usage scenarios, sequences, patterns, and associated frequencies or probabilities,while CBT views the objects from a developer’s 
Stopping criteria: UBST use product reliability|goals as the exit criterion; and CBT using coverage goals - surrogates or approximations of reliability goals
Usage-based vs. coverage-based stopping criteria and corresponding|testing techniques, with the former attempting to reach certain reliability goals by focusing on functions and feature frequently
Overall objectives and goals, which can be refined into specific|goals for specific testing. Some specific goals include reliability for usage-based statistical testing or coverage for various traditional testing techniques
Objects to be tested and the specific focus|Functional testing views the software product as a black-box and focuses on testing the external functional behavior
Information source identification and data collection| The information and data are generally affected by both what is required by specific models and what is available in the project environment
Analysis and initial model construction: The information|and data collected above are analyzed to construct testing models
Model validation and incremental improvement|This is an important step, particularly for large objects or for functions or usages associated with external customers
A test case|is a collection of entities and related information that allows a test to be executed or a test run to be performed
A test run|is a dynamic unit of specific test activities in the overall testing sequence on a selected testing object
Dependencies among individual test cases|Some test cases can only be run after others because one is used to set up another
Defect detection related sequencing|Many problems can only be effectively detected after others have been discovered and fixed
Sequences to  avoid accidents|For some systems,  possibly  severe problems and damages may incur during testing if certain areas were not checked through related test
Problem diagnosis related sequencing|Some execution problems observed during testing may involve complicated scenarios and many
Natural grouping of test cases|such as by functional and structural areas or by usage frequencies, can also be used for test sequencing and to manage parallel testing
General steps in test execution include|Allocating test time and resources,nvoking and running tests, and collecting execution information and measurements;Checking testing results and identifying system failures
Result checking, or the oracle problem|and the related failure identification is a difficult task, because of both the theoretical difficulties and practical limitations
Analysis of individual test runs includes|result checking and failure identification we covered in the previous section as part of the test execution activities
Problem diagnosis to examine|what kind of problem it is, where, when, and possible causes. This may involve analyzing the above records and using some diagnostic
Fault locating, to identify the exact location(s)|of fault(s) based on information from the previous steps and product knowledge
Defect Jixing, to fix the located fault(s) by adding|removing, or correcting certain parts of the code
Reliability  analysis for  usage-based testing|which can be used to assess  current product reliability and as input to determine if the pre-set reliability goal has been achieved
Coverage analysis for coverage-based testing|which can be used as a surrogate for reliability and used as the stopping criterion or as input to various decisions related to testing management
Overall  defect analysis|which can be used to examine defect distribution and to identify high-defect areas for focused remedial actions
vertical model would organize around a product|where dedicated people perform one or more testing tasks for the product.
horizontal model is used  in some large organizations|so that a testing team only performs one kind of testing for many different products within the organization
Various issues related to test automation include|specific needs and potential for autornation; selection of existing testing tools if available;possibility and cost of constructing specific test automation tools; availability of user training for these tools and time/effort needed;
McCabe Test from McCabe|and Associates provides control flow coverage related information and analysis. 
S-TCAT (System Test Coverage Analysis Tool) from SRI|provides function-level coverage and call-pair information
ATAC|from Telecodia is a data flow coverage analysis tool for white-box testing. 
Test planning and preparation|setting goal, sellecting overall strategies and techniques gathering information constructing testing modelspreparing individual test cases
Test execution and measurement|allocating and adjusting test time and resources,invoking and running tests, and taking appropriate measurements,checking testing results and identifying system failures.
Pre-QA activities| Quality planning:These are the activities that should be carried out before carrying out the regular QA activities
quantify these quality expectations to set appropriate quality goals in two steps|We need to select or define the quality measurements and models,We need to find out the expected values or ranges of the corresponding quality
The influence of quality perspectives and attributes|For different kinds of customers, users, and market segments, different QA alternatives might be appropriate
The influence of different quality Levels|Quantitative quality levels as specified in the quality goals may also affect the choice of appropriate QA techniques
Measurement: Besides defect measurements|collected during defect handling, which is typically carried out as part of the normal QA activities, various other measurements 
Analysis and modeling|These activities analyze measurement data from software projects and fit them  to analytical models that provide quantitative assessment of selected quality characteristics or sub-characteristics
Providing feedback and identifying improvement potentials|Results from the above analysis and modeling activities can provide feedback to the quality engineering process
Follow-up activities|Besides the immediate use of analysis and modeling results described above,various follow-up activities can be carried out to affect the long-term quality and organizational performance
The quality engineering process|forms an integral part of the overall software engineering process, where other concerns, such as cost and schedule, are also considered and managed
In alternative software processes other than waterfall|such as in incremental, iterative, spiral, and extreme programming processes
For normal project monitoring and management under any process|appropriate measurement activities need to be carried out to collect or extract data from the software process
Minor modifications|are needed to  integrate quality engineering activities into other development processes
Quality planning drives|and should precede the other two groups of activities
The collective effort of selected QA activities|generally demonstrated the following pattern|gradual build-up process for individual QA activities
Quality Planning before specific QA activities are carried out|in the so-called pre-QA activities in software quality engineering
Quality quantization|and improvement through measurement, analysis, feedback,and follow-up activities
the biggest obstacle to formal methods|is the high cost associated with the difficult task of performing these human intensive activities correctly without adequate automated support
The question of applicability can be answered in two steps|The type of products or application domains that would benefit,..The type of software artifacts in the above products
The most commonly verified or analyzed objects| are the program code
The basic reason behind this is the shared formalism and formal language|that can be used to describe, model, and analyze different type of systems, not just limited
In terms of the software artifacts from different development phases being verified and analyze| these techniques are closely related to and depend upon the availability of formal system specifications, either as formal descriptions
Formal verification and analysis|is most closely related  to formal inspection, review, and static analysis
formal methods belong to the defect prevention category|with formal specifications eliminating certain error sources due to poor understanding of product requirements and formal verification confirming the absence of certain defects.
The use of recovery blocks|occasional failures only cause loss of partial computational results but not complete execution failures
Periodic checkpointing and refreshing to save the dynamic contents of software executions|Sometimes this activity can be associated with the completion of some major tasks or occurrence of some significant events, in addition to at the pre-determinedtime instances
Failure detection|This activity is typically associated with the checkpointing activity above
before a new checkpoint can be established|some consistency check is carried out to see if there is an execution failure or other suspected
If a failure is detected|1. Rollback by restoring the saved dynamic contents2. Rerun the lost computation.
In using recovery blocks, failures are detected|but the underlying faults are not removed
The limited capability for fault tolerance is achieved through fault avoidance|due to different execution path or execution condition that does not involve the fault code
Another issue is the maintenance and follow-up activities to normal operations|repeated failures need to be dealt with by taking the system off-line for defect analysis and fixing
Analysis of actual or potential accident scenarios|with a focus on preconditions, or hazards, for these scenarios This type of analysis is called hazard analysis
Preventive and remedial actions for accident prevention|referred to as hazard resolution, to deal with the hazards identified in the above analysis
Generic ways include hazard elimination|hazard reduction, and hazard control. 
The basic analysis tool is logical diagrams called fault-trees|which also represent the analysis results
The analysis follows a top-down procedure|starting with the top event and recursively analyzing each event or condition to find out its logical conditions or sub-conditions
An event tree|is a temporal cause-effect diagram We start with the primary event and follow through its subsequent events and consequences over time or stages
Each branch of the event tree|represents a specific consequence of a decision, which in turn can be associated with their own subsequent decisions and consequences
The main usage of ETA is to recreate accident sequences and/or scenarios|the critical paths that lead from the primary events through a sequence of decisions
Hazard elimination through substitution|simplification, decoupling, elimination of specific human errors, and reduction of hazardous materials or conditions
Hazard reduction through design for controllability|use of locking devices and failure probability minimization using safety margins and redundancy
Hazard control|through reducing exposure, isolation and containment protection system
damage control|also involves accident analysis that guide planned and actual strategies for damage control in the unfortunate event that accidents do happen
Detection or observation|of specific problems from specific defect perspectives during the performance of specific QA activities
Types of follow-up actions|that deal with the observed or detected problems in specific ways as examined from the defect perspectives
Defect prevention|works  to block some errors or to remove error sources to prevent the injection of related faults
One key difference between inspection and testing|is the way faults are identified
Inspection involves static examination| while testing involves dynamic executions
It is hard for human inspectors to keep track of multiple components and complicated interactions over time|while the same task may not be such a difficult one for computers
Human inspectors can focus on a small area and perform|in-depth analysis, leading to effective detection of localized faults
Formal verification|deals with logical (or mathematical) correctness, and can be interpreted as extremely formalized inspection
Fault tolerance and failure|containment are designed to work with dynamic operational problems that may lead to global failures and accidents
For existing products with relatively high defect levels or with many common faults|inspection is most likely to be more effective than testing
A proof of correctness of a formal verification|can only be produced if the program is fault-free with respect to its formal specification
When verification cannot be successfully|further analysis can often reveal accidental logical or functional faults
Fault tolerance techniques|generally involve the observations of dynamic local failures failures and the tolerance of the related faults but not the identification and removal of these faults
Most traditional QA activities|such as testing and inspection, focus on defect detection and removal
Operational cost of having specific mechanisms|in the operational systems, which may slow down the overall system, reduce the system capacity, or negatively affect other performance measures
Implementation cost to design|implement, and ensure selected features and mechanisms, such as backups and redundancies
Failure or accident cost|which is similar to the dormant defect cost considered above for defect prevention and defect reduction techniques
Among the three, failure/accident|cost need to be balanced against the other two to justify  spending valuable resources to implement and operate these fault tolerance 
active design reviews (ADR) to ensure inspectors’ active participation, | the author prepares questionnaires to focus on specific scenarios or areas
these analyses can be used in testing or other QA activities |  Decision table and decision tree analyses,Boundary value analysis is related to testing,Finite-state machine analysis is most closely related,ontrol flow and data dependency analyses
The basic idea of domain testing | to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain
to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain | called domain analysis, or input domain analysis
There are several important characteristics for this testing technique | It tests  UO  (inputloutput) relations by providing input values associated with all the individual input variables.The output variable values are not explicitly specified.  But, we assume that there are ways to check if the expected output is obtained for any given input.
The input domain consists of all the points representing  all the allowable | input com-binations  specified for the program  in the product specification. 
An input sub-domain is a subset of the input domain.  In general,  a sub-domain can be defined by a set of inequalities  in the form of | f(x1,x2,...xn)< K ,
A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains | A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains
A boundary  is where  two sub-domains meet.  When inequalities  are used  to define sub-domains as above, the following equation would give us a specific boundary: |  f(x1,x2,...xn) = K ,
A boundary is a linear boundary if  it is defined by | a1x1+ a2x2+...+anxn = K 
 If a sub-domain whose boundaries  are all  linear  one |  it  is called  a linear sub-domain
A point on a boundary  is called | a boundary point
if all the boundary points belong to the sub-domain | A boundary  is a closed one with respect to a specific sub-domain
if  none of  the boundary  points belong to the sub-domain | A  boundary  is  an  open one  with  respect  to  a  specific  sub-domain
the specific variations  of domain testing depend on | how this third step is carried out
The simplest strategy is | to sample one test  point  from inside each sub-domain in  the partition,  thus  achieving complete coverage of  all  the  sub-domains
Most of such cases indicate problems in the product pecification or in the implementation | which result in different output for the same input or  the system behaves incorrectly 
The most common situations for this kind of problems to occur is | when computational procedures  are defined for individual sub-domains
the problem with whether the boundary points belong to this sub-domain under consideration | Closureproblem
 problem refers to the disagreement with where exactly a boundary is between the intended and the actual boundary | Boundary shift
If a  boundary  is missing, that means the two neighboring sub-domains will collapse into one subdomain | Missing  boundary
Extreme-point combination |  one of the oldest domain testing strategies that are still used by people and supported by some testing tools
uses n ON points and  1  OFF points  to be defined below for each boundary | Weak N  X  1 strategy
In an n-dimensional space, a boundary defined by an equation in the form of  | f(x~,xi!, *. .yxn) = K 
If  the  boundary  is  a  closed  boundary with  respect  to  the  sub-domain under consideration | the OFF point will be outside the sub-domain or be an exterior point. 
If  the boundary  is  an  open  boundary  with  respect  to  the  sub-domain  under consideration | the OFF point  will  be  inside the sub-domain or be an  interior point
An extra boundary would likely  | to cause some of these IN points to receive different processing if  it separates them  apart
in  the two-dimensional space, it should be chosen by | Choosing the midpoint between the two ON points, Then  moving  6  distance off  the  boundary,  outward  or  inward  for 
boundary problems are considered below | Extra boundaly,Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
With extra boundary, more ON points would enhance the possibility that the extra boundary  | Extra boundaly
When boundary tilt or general boundary change  is concerned | Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
For nonlinear boundaries | n points are not enough to define the boundary
Other types of  boundaries and extensions  | Limits or boundaries associated ,The ideas  can be  used  for capacity  testing
parameters  can  be specified for queues, including | Pre-emptive or not,Butching,Synchronization
 the following sub-cases are tested | When the queue is empty,he cases with  1 or 2 elements already in...
One significant different between queuing testing and input domain boundary testing | the dynamic and continuous nature of the former as compared with...
  the most  important  areas where  partition-based  testing  has made a  strong impact  |   input domain testing
The basic testing  models | constructed  based on the simple assumption  that  the...
information  processing  model | assumed to be a simple classify-and-process  one
Weak  1 x  1 uses few test points and can detect most of the boundary problems most of the time | Therefore, it should be a primary candidate for boundary testing. 
When high quality requirements need | to be met or specific types of  problems that weak 1 x  1 cannot address are suspected
The basic  idea of  FSMs |  use an  intermediate formalism to  model the program exe-cution or behavior that strikes
Some of  the basic  assumptions in those extensions include: | here is a finite number of stages or lists,Each stage or list is unique, that is, no stage or list ,The final choices made through multiple stages or lists are uni
 four basic elements for FSMs | Static elements,Dynamic  elements
The subset of  static elements includes states and state transitions. | Static elements
The subset of  dynamic elements includes the input  provided to the FSMs and the output generated | Dynamic  elements
consider the following execution sequence | When a program starts,After performing a user-oriented function,the above step can be repeated a number,the state where program execution,In  each of  the transitions

State problems | missing,  extra, or incorrect states
State problems: missing,  extra, or incorrect states: | An incorrect  state is one,A missing  state,Extra state may be related 
Transition problems | missing, extra, or incorrect transitions; 
Transition problems : missing, extra, or incorrect transitions | A missing transition  is one,An extra transition  is associated,An incorrect transition is a transition
Input problems | In FSM-based testihg,  we typically treat
construct FSMs and validate them in the following steps | 1.Information source ,2.Construction of initial FSMs
State identification and enumeration | We need to keep the number of states to a manageable level
Transition identification with the help of input values | For each state, we can consider all the possible transitions in connection with
The basic  idea for identifying missing states or transitions is | similar to checklist- and partition-based testing. For example, a checklist based on produ
Checking for extra states and transitions can follow | essentially the same procedure by cross-validating them  with  the information sources
In  trying to reach a specific state, each test case is | essentially a series of  input values that enables us to make
From the current state, the next state to visit | determined by the input. 
Test case sensitization for FSM-based testing is | fairly easy and straightforward
Since each transition is | associated with specific input values, we can simply select such input values to sensitize the test case.
 FSM-modeled systems | input and output are associated with individual transitions instead of as an indistinguishable lump of  initial input for many other systems
FSM-based testing  | generally  suitable for systems with  clearly identifiable  states and state transitions.
FSM-based testing has |  received significant attention is the testing of object-oriented  software and systems
The primary  limitation  of FSM-based  testing is | its  inability to handle large number of states.  
Client - Web Browsers 
Multi-layered web applications  | Web Server >Middleware> Database - Backend 
Traditional menu-driven software usually | separates its navigation from its computation; while the two are tightly mingled for web-based applications
in traditional menu-driven software | usually a single top menu that serves as the entry point;
Another  significant difference | the qualitative difference in  the  huge  number of navigational pages 
Web-based applications typically | involve much more diverse support facilities than traditional menu-driven software

The key to path sensitization | is the decision or branching nodes and the associated conditions
For test oracles,  we can take advantage | of the internal or intermediate steps in CFT to sample intermediate states for some consistency conditions.

The basic idea of data flow testing (DFT) is | to test the correct handling of data
The links in DDGs represent the D-U relation, or “is used by”
For DFT, test preparation includes the following steps: | Build and verify the DDGs>Define and  select data slices to cover>Sensitize the data slices or the test>Plan for result checking
the DDGs typically show the following characteristics | here is usually one output data item,There are typically more input variables and constants,Multiple inlinks are common,Since the DDG is typically shown
DFT is | more often white-box than black-box
such constructed DDGs is | the identification of variables in specifications or implementations
The use of  loops | would significantly complicate the DDGs
The situation is much  worse than  in  CFT | where only execution path  is analyzed but  not the detail
The main advantages of such integrations include: | Benefit enhancement,increased flexibility
Benefit enhancement | By taking advantage of the different techniques, the integrated strategies can be used to perform not only the original

can be estimated by the slope ofthe fitted SRGMs, and overall reliability change (or reliability growth due to failure observations and fault removals) can be characterized by the slope change from the beginning of testing to the current time|Using SRGMs, product reliability at a given time
Test run data over time can be easily collected (Section 22.6), consistently used to track testing progress, and can lead to accurate reliability assessments with SRGMs if runs are homogeneous|Many uses oftest run counts
For large software systems studied here, becausemany test runs involve little execution and much setup and manual operations, SRGMs fitted to execution time data do not perform well|Limited applicability of execution time
When run homogeneity cannot be assured, detailed usage measurements, such as measured by transactions, can be used effectively for reliability analyses with SRGMs|Using transactions
These results and related studies of other products or systems (Tian et al., 1995; Tian, 1995; Tian and Palma, 1997; Tian et al., 2004) point to several important conclusions, including|Many uses oftest run counts,Limited applicability of execution time,Using transactions

the questionsasked during the analyses are similar|What?,Where?,When?,Pre- or post-release?,How and Why?
The identification and classification of the discovered defects can be performed to identify what they are and classify them by some consistent scheme. This topic is the focus of this chapter, which is discussed in all subsequent sections|What?
Where was the defect found or discovered? This information can be used to provide valuable feedback to the development process through defect distribution analysis|Where?
The identificationof the exact time or associated development phase or subphase when a defect is injected and when it is discovered is important, because it provides information to analyze the overall defect trend and serves as the basis for quality prediction into the future|When?
An important extension to the “when” question is whether a defect is a pre-release defect or a post-release defect, sometimes labeled as an indevelopment(or in-process)or an in-field defect, respectively|Pre- or post-release?
How was the defect injected into the software,and why? These two questions are closely related, both pertaining to the cause of the discovered defects|How and Why?

Defect causal analysis can usually take two forms|logical analysis and statistical analysis.

a probabilistic analysis that examines the statistical link between causes and effects and deduces the probable causal relations between the two|Statistical analysis

can help us obtain an objective assessment of our current product quality, in contrast to the often unreliable subjective assessment based on personal judgment or imprecise qualitative assessment|MODELS FOR QUALITY ASSESSMENT
We define quality assessment models as analytical models that provide quantitative assessment of selected quality characteristics or sub-characteristics based on|measurement data from software projects
the correctness aspect of quality can be measured and derived ___ from its definitions|directly
we also need to monitor these ____ quality measurements and analyze them using various quality assessment models, so that we can assure and improve quality by controlling these indirect entities, particularly in the early part of software development process|indirect
Depending on whether product-specific measurements and results are used and provided, we can classify existing quality assessment models into two broad categories|generalized models and product-speciJicmodels 
compared by looking at their ability to provide useful information, their applicability to different project environments, and their inter-connections|Different types of quality assessment models and their relations

Decisions without explicit quality assessment|Implicit,Indirect,Otherfactors
such as completion of planned test activities, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly assumes the effectiveness of the testing activities|Implicit quality assessments
such as achieving certain test coverage goals, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly equates coverage levels to reliability levels.|Indirect quality assessments
such asproject schedule, cost, and resource utilization, can sometimes be used as exit criteria.|Otherfactors
Decisions based on explicit quality assessments|Failure-related, Fault-related
from a customer’sor external perspective, such as various reliability measures and impact assessments|Failure-related quality assessments
from a developer’s or internal perspective,such as defect density and count estimates for latent defects.|Fault-related quality assessments  
This decision is probably the one most closely identified with product release or phasehb-phase termination decisions. When there is a mismatch between a product’s quality progress and project schedule, adjustment is called for. The quality assessment results typically will indicate when the quality goal will be satisfied. This input can be used to delay (more often) or speed up (less often) the project schedule.|Schedule adjustment
Similar to the above, if a project is behind schedule or ahead of schedule, resource allocation decisions may be made to try to compensate for it by adding or removing certain resources, although the impact of this is limited (Brooks, 1995). | Resource allocation and adjustment
Sometimes, product release decisions are made regardless of the current quality level.|Planning for post-release product support
can be based on an assessment of quality strength and weakness of the current product, or a comparison between this and othercompetitive products| Planning forfuture products 
The follow-upand improvement can be concentratedin three major areas|Futureproduct, Process,people quality improvement
This is similar to the above feedbackand followup activities,but with the added hindsight. Better quality planning can be formulated based on the experience of the current project, both in terms of goal setting and the selectionof the overall QA strategies. |Futureproduct quality improvement 
This improvement can be achievedin two generalareas, the quality engineering process itself and the general software engineering process. The former can be based on the experience with carrying out the current quality engineering process, while the latter would also benefit greatly from alternativeexperience using other development processes to develop similar products|Processquality improvement
A more intangible benefit is the experience gained by
people in many areas, including domain knowledgeof the specific product, software process and technology experience, and quality engineering knowledge. Their experience can be packaged to ensure effective transfer of the collective knowledge and experience, or the so-called institutional memory, to new project personnel.|People quality improvement
the correctness aspect of quality can often be ____ derived from its definition or related to various defect measurements. |directly
To ensure proper collection and usage of various measurement data, we need to pay special attention to the following| Consistent interpretation and tracking,Timely defect and data reporting,Proper data granularity
For defects, we need to distinguish execution failures, internal faults, and errors in human actions. The specific problems need to be counted and tracked consistently. Similarly, other measurements also require us to maintain consistent interpretation.|Consistent interpretation and tracking
Because these measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely reporting of defects and other dynamic measurements to keep the information current.|Timely defect and data reporting
Different quality analyses and models might require data at different levels of granularity. We will examine this aspect further in connection with models for quality assessment and improvement in Chapter 19|Proper data granularity

being measured, including control (for example, control flow paths), data (for example, operand count), and presentation (for example,different indentation rules used).|Product (internal)attributes
Different attributes of the software artifacts may be treated as an unstructured heap of symbols (for example, raw count such as LOCline of code), or as syntactical structures (for example, various control flow path measurements (Fenton and Pfleeger, 1996)), or even as interconnected semantic entities (for example, context-sensitive measures such as live data definitions (Tai, 1984)).|Measurement of structures

Functional (black-box) checklists at different levels of abstraction and granularity,| ranging from major high-level functions ...
Checklists of system elements (white-box) at different levels of granularity, | ranging from sub-systems and modules at the high level to individual 
Checklists about certain properties, such as coding standard, specific specification items, etc., which can be either black-box or white-box
A common way to obtain usable checklists is to | select items from several exhaustive checklists based on some criteria and to combine them
The most commonly used form of multiple checklists is | the hierarchical checklist
each item in a higher-level checklist expandable to a full checklist | at a lower level until we stop at a level of detail deemed enough by some criteria
One of the important characteristics of these checklists is that |they are typically not veryspecific, particularly those high-level ones
the increased demand for more automation, service, and functionality, modern software systems | also become larger and more complex
It would be hard to come up with checklists that cover all the functional (black-box) or structural (white-box) components| from different perspectives and at different levels
a lot of overlaps between different items in the checklists may be introduced, resulting in redundant testing effort when such checklists are used.
Some complex interactions of different system components or among major system functions are | hard or impossible to describe using checklists
this testing strategy directly corresponds to the checklist-based testing, with the domain partition as the checklist, and each sub-domain corresponding to a single element in the checklis
The subsets are mutually exclusive, that is,| no two subsets share any common member
The subsets are collectively exhaustive, that is, they collectively cover or include | all the elements in the original set
we simply select one item for testing at a time from the subset as a representative of the corresponding | equivalent class until we have exhausted all the subsets
if operations associated with one particular sub-domain are used more often than others, each underlying defect related to this sub-domain is also more likely to cause
The information related to usage scenarios, patterns, and related usage frequency| by target customers and users needs to be collected
Testing needs to be performed | in accordance with the OPs
Testing results can be analyzed to assess product reliability and provide feedback | to the testing and the general software development process
the actual testing is typically performed late in the overall product development process,| and the model construction could be and should be started much earlier
the operational profiles (OPs) need to be | constructed with customer and user input
testing according to customer usage scenarios and frequencies captured in OPs cannot be | performed until most of the product components have been implemented
each operation corresponds to an individual sub-domain | in domain partitions, thus representing a whole equivalence class
It is customary to sort the operations by descending | probabilities of usage and present the results in that order
It is common to have quite uneven distribution of usage probabilities, with a | few frequently used ones account for most of the usage frequencies
if some operations have very low probability of usage,| we could omit them in the OP
it can be used to support statistical testing by some random sampling procedure to | select test cases according to the probability distribution and execute them
each operation in the OP corresponds to certain test cases specifically constructed or| selected from existing ones to specifically test this system operation
Productivity improvement and schedule gains could be achieved because of | the focus on high-leverage parts with the use of OPs
Introducing new products by implementing highly used features quickly to capture market share | and then gradually adding lesser-used features in subsequent releases or product updates
The use of OPs can foster better communications with | target customers and help establish and maintain better customer relations
The use of OPs can help develop more precise product requirements and specifications, | which are more likely to satisfy customers’ needs
Customer and user training can be better focused on those features that the customers | use the most instead of esoteric ones more likely to be used by internal users
The exact way used to handle defects is also influenced by | the specific QA activities that led to their initial discovery, the project environment, and other factors
The most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution, which ensures that each discovered defect is |corrected or taken care of through appropriate actions.
Each corrected or fixed defect needs to be re-verified to ensure failure-free executions | under the same execution conditions
Defect logging | or the initial reporting and recording of a discovered defect This  ensures that a record will be kept for every discovered defect
Defect tracking | which monitors and records what happened to each defect after its initial discovery, up until its final resolution
Consistent defect interpretation and tracking | We need to distinguish execution failures,internal faults, and human errors. The specific problems need to be counted andtracked consistently
Timely defect reporting | Because defect measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely defect reporting to keep the information current
The exception is | unit testing, which is usually carried out parallel to coding by the same person
Most defects from unit testing are not | formally tracked because they are considered as part of the implementation activities
Defect handling is implicitly assumed to be part of the project  | management activities, which is handled in similar ways as configuration management.
A formalized defect handling process highlights important | activities and associated rules,parties involved, and their responsibilities. 
It is typically defined by the differentstates |  associated with individual defect status and transitions among these states due to status changes
Different defect handling processes may include | different collections of defect status and other possible attributes.
Defect handling is not closely associated with |  defect prevention.
The focus is not on the discovery of underlying faults that cause | failures and possible accidents
Defect information can be used | as additional input
Among the different QA activities, defect containment activities play | an important role in post-release product operations and maintenance support
Repeated use of recovery blocks for the same situations may be an | indication of software problems instead of 
Most of the implementation activities need to be carried out | during software development, not after product release...
including defect prevention and defect reduction, are performed | during software development instead of during in-field software support after
A typical sequence includes, in chronological order: | product planning, requirement analysis,specification, design, coding, testing, release...
The error sources are typically associated with activities in these early phases, such as  | conceptual mistakes by designers and programmers,unfamiliarity with the product domain...
The vast majority of faults are  | injected in the early development phases, particularly in detailed design and implementation phases
failure prevention and containment activities, such as fault tolerance and safety assurance, | are typically the focus of operational phases
QA activities, typically inspections and reviews, carried out at the transitions | from one phase to the next are shown as barriers or gates to pass. 
The exception to this is between testing and release, where | the reviews are typically accompanied by acceptance testing
The general distribution scope is |shown by the dotted bracket, with a focus on defect prevention in the early phases, a focus on defect removal during coding and testing phases...
the overall process can be viewed as consisting of several | increments or iterations
integration testing plays a very important role, to make sure that | different parts can inter-operate seamlessly to fulfill the intended functionalities correctly together
System testing, where the focus is | the overall set of system functions to be provided to users
Usage-based statistical testing, where | the operational environment by target users is simulated during software testing before product release
Software fault tolerance, which focuses on | providing continued service expected by customers even when local problems exist
Software safety assurance activities, which focus on | providing the expected accidentfree operations or reducing accident damage when an accident is unavoidable
Software verification activities check | the conformance of a software system to its specifications

The basic idea of domain testing | to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain
to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain | called domain analysis, or input domain analysis
There are several important characteristics for this testing technique | It tests  UO  (inputloutput) relations by providing input values associated with all the individual input variables.The output variable values are not explicitly specified.  But, we assume that there are ways to check if the expected output is obtained for any given input.
The input domain consists of all the points representing  all the allowable | input com-binations  specified for the program  in the product specification. 
An input sub-domain is a subset of the input domain.  In general,  a sub-domain can be defined by a set of inequalities  in the form of | f(x1,x2,...xn)< K ,
A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains | A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains
A boundary  is where  two sub-domains meet.  When inequalities  are used  to define sub-domains as above, the following equation would give us a specific boundary: |  f(x1,x2,...xn) = K ,
A boundary is a linear boundary if  it is defined by | a1x1+ a2x2+...+anxn = K 
 If a sub-domain whose boundaries  are all  linear  one |  it  is called  a linear sub-domain
A point on a boundary  is called | a boundary point
if all the boundary points belong to the sub-domain | A boundary  is a closed one with respect to a specific sub-domain
if  none of  the boundary  points belong to the sub-domain | A  boundary  is  an  open one  with  respect  to  a  specific  sub-domain
the specific variations  of domain testing depend on | how this third step is carried out
The simplest strategy is | to sample one test  point  from inside each sub-domain in  the partition,  thus  achieving complete coverage of  all  the  sub-domains
Most of such cases indicate problems in the product pecification or in the implementation | which result in different output for the same input or  the system behaves incorrectly 
The most common situations for this kind of problems to occur is | when computational procedures  are defined for individual sub-domains
the problem with whether the boundary points belong to this sub-domain under consideration | Closureproblem
 problem refers to the disagreement with where exactly a boundary is between the intended and the actual boundary | Boundary shift
If a  boundary  is missing, that means the two neighboring sub-domains will collapse into one subdomain | Missing  boundary
Extreme-point combination |  one of the oldest domain testing strategies that are still used by people and supported by some testing tools
uses n ON points and  1  OFF points  to be defined below for each boundary | Weak N  X  1 strategy
In an n-dimensional space, a boundary defined by an equation in the form of  | f(x~,xi!, *. .yxn) = K 
If  the  boundary  is  a  closed  boundary with  respect  to  the  sub-domain under consideration | the OFF point will be outside the sub-domain or be an exterior point. 
If  the boundary  is  an  open  boundary  with  respect  to  the  sub-domain  under consideration | the OFF point  will  be  inside the sub-domain or be an  interior point
An extra boundary would likely  | to cause some of these IN points to receive different processing if  it separates them  apart
in  the two-dimensional space, it should be chosen by | Choosing the midpoint between the two ON points, Then  moving  6  distance off  the  boundary,  outward  or  inward  for 
boundary problems are considered below | Extra boundaly,Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
With extra boundary, more ON points would enhance the possibility that the extra boundary  | Extra boundaly
When boundary tilt or general boundary change  is concerned | Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
For nonlinear boundaries | n points are not enough to define the boundary
Other types of  boundaries and extensions  | Limits or boundaries associated ,The ideas  can be  used  for capacity  testing

 the following sub-cases are tested | When the queue is empty,he cases with  1 or 2 elements already in...
One significant different between queuing testing and input domain boundary testing | the dynamic and continuous nature of the former as compared with...
  the most  important  areas where  partition-based  testing  has made a  strong impact  |   input domain testing
The basic testing  models | constructed  based on the simple assumption  that  the...
information  processing  model | assumed to be a simple classify-and-process  one
Weak  1 x  1 uses few test points and can detect most of the boundary problems most of the time | Therefore, it should be a primary candidate for boundary testing. 
When high quality requirements need | to be met or specific types of  problems that weak 1 x  1 cannot address are suspected
The basic  idea of  FSMs |  use an  intermediate formalism to  model the program exe-cution or behavior that strikes
Some of  the basic  assumptions in those extensions include: | here is a finite number of stages or lists,Each stage or list is unique, that is, no stage or list ,The final choices made through multiple stages or lists are uni
 four basic elements for FSMs | Static elements,Dynamic  elements
The subset of  static elements includes states and state transitions. | Static elements
The subset of  dynamic elements includes the input  provided to the FSMs and the output generated | Dynamic  elements
consider the following execution sequence | When a program starts,After performing a user-oriented function,the above step can be repeated a number,the state where program execution,In  each of  the transitions

State problems | missing,  extra, or incorrect states
State problems: missing,  extra, or incorrect states: | An incorrect  state is one,A missing  state,Extra state may be related 
Transition problems | missing, extra, or incorrect transitions; 
Transition problems : missing, extra, or incorrect transitions | A missing transition  is one,An extra transition  is associated,An incorrect transition is a transition
Input problems | In FSM-based testihg,  we typically treat
construct FSMs and validate them in the following steps | 1.Information source ,2.Construction of initial FSMs
State identification and enumeration | We need to keep the number of states to a manageable level
Transition identification with the help of input values | For each state, we can consider all the possible transitions in connection with
The basic  idea for identifying missing states or transitions is | similar to checklist- and partition-based testing. For example, a checklist based on produ
Checking for extra states and transitions can follow | essentially the same procedure by cross-validating them  with  the information sources
In  trying to reach a specific state, each test case is | essentially a series of  input values that enables us to make
From the current state, the next state to visit | determined by the input. 
Test case sensitization for FSM-based testing is | fairly easy and straightforward
Since each transition is | associated with specific input values, we can simply select such input values to sensitize the test case.
 FSM-modeled systems | input and output are associated with individual transitions instead of as an indistinguishable lump of  initial input for many other systems
FSM-based testing  | generally  suitable for systems with  clearly identifiable  states and state transitions.
FSM-based testing has |  received significant attention is the testing of object-oriented  software and systems
The primary  limitation  of FSM-based  testing is | its  inability to handle large number of states.

This model also includes a predictive element, enabling the user of this model to estimate model parameters from product and process characteristics even before actual failures are|observed
can be estimated by the slope ofthe fitted SRGMs, and overall reliability change (or reliability growth due to failure observations and fault removals) can be characterized by the slope change from the beginning of testing to the current time|Using SRGMs, product reliability at a given time
Test run data over time can be easily collected (Section 22.6), consistently used to track testing progress, and can lead to accurate reliability assessments with SRGMs if runs are homogeneous|Many uses oftest run counts
For large software systems studied here, becausemany test runs involve little execution and much setup and manual operations, SRGMs fitted to execution time data do not perform well|Limited applicability of execution time
When run homogeneity cannot be assured, detailed usage measurements, such as measured by transactions, can be used effectively for reliability analyses with SRGMs|Using transactions
These results and related studies of other products or systems (Tian et al., 1995; Tian, 1995; Tian and Palma, 1997; Tian et al., 2004) point to several important conclusions, including|Many uses oftest run counts,Limited applicability of execution time,Using transactions

also has a significant influence on the practical applications of specific techniques|Availability of tool support
the questionsasked during the analyses are similar|What?,Where?,When?,Pre- or post-release?,How and Why?
The identification and classification of the discovered defects can be performed to identify what they are and classify them by some consistent scheme. This topic is the focus of this chapter, which is discussed in all subsequent sections|What?
Where was the defect found or discovered? This information can be used to provide valuable feedback to the development process through defect distribution analysis|Where?
The identificationof the exact time or associated development phase or subphase when a defect is injected and when it is discovered is important, because it provides information to analyze the overall defect trend and serves as the basis for quality prediction into the future|When?
An important extension to the “when” question is whether a defect is a pre-release defect or a post-release defect, sometimes labeled as an indevelopment(or in-process)or an in-field defect, respectively|Pre- or post-release?
How was the defect injected into the software,and why? These two questions are closely related, both pertaining to the cause of the discovered defects|How and Why?

Defect causal analysis can usually take two forms|logical analysis and statistical analysis.

a probabilistic analysis that examines the statistical link between causes and effects and deduces the probable causal relations between the two|Statistical analysis

can help us obtain an objective assessment of our current product quality, in contrast to the often unreliable subjective assessment based on personal judgment or imprecise qualitative assessment|MODELS FOR QUALITY ASSESSMENT

we also need to monitor these ____ quality measurements and analyze them using various quality assessment models, so that we can assure and improve quality by controlling these indirect entities, particularly in the early part of software development process|indirect
Depending on whether product-specific measurements and results are used and provided, we can classify existing quality assessment models into two broad categories|generalized models and product-speciJicmodels

Decisions without explicit quality assessment|Implicit,Indirect,Otherfactors
such as completion of planned test activities, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly assumes the effectiveness of the testing activities|Implicit quality assessments
such as achieving certain test coverage goals, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly equates coverage levels to reliability levels.|Indirect quality assessments
such asproject schedule, cost, and resource utilization, can sometimes be used as exit criteria.|Otherfactors

from a customer’sor external perspective, such as various reliability measures and impact assessments|Failure-related quality assessments
from a developer’s or internal perspective,such as defect density and count estimates for latent defects.|Fault-related quality assessments  
This decision is probably the one most closely identified with product release or phasehb-phase termination decisions. When there is a mismatch between a product’s quality progress and project schedule, adjustment is called for. The quality assessment results typically will indicate when the quality goal will be satisfied. This input can be used to delay (more often) or speed up (less often) the project schedule.|Schedule adjustment
Similar to the above, if a project is behind schedule or ahead of schedule, resource allocation decisions may be made to try to compensate for it by adding or removing certain resources, although the impact of this is limited (Brooks, 1995). | Resource allocation and adjustment
Sometimes, product release decisions are made regardless of the current quality level.|Planning for post-release product support
can be based on an assessment of quality strength and weakness of the current product, or a comparison between this and othercompetitive products| Planning forfuture products 
The follow-upand improvement can be concentratedin three major areas|Futureproduct, Process,people quality improvement
This is similar to the above feedbackand followup activities,but with the added hindsight. Better quality planning can be formulated based on the experience of the current project, both in terms of goal setting and the selectionof the overall QA strategies. |Futureproduct quality improvement 
This improvement can be achievedin two generalareas, the quality engineering process itself and the general software engineering process. The former can be based on the experience with carrying out the current quality engineering process, while the latter would also benefit greatly from alternativeexperience using other development processes to develop similar products|Processquality improvement
A more intangible benefit is the experience gained by
people in many areas, including domain knowledgeof the specific product, software process and technology experience, and quality engineering knowledge. Their experience can be packaged to ensure effective transfer of the collective knowledge and experience, or the so-called institutional memory, to new project personnel.|People quality improvement
the correctness aspect of quality can often be ____ derived from its definition or related to various defect measurements. |directly
To ensure proper collection and usage of various measurement data, we need to pay special attention to the following| Consistent interpretation and tracking,Timely defect and data reporting,Proper data granularity
For defects, we need to distinguish execution failures, internal faults, and errors in human actions. The specific problems need to be counted and tracked consistently. Similarly, other measurements also require us to maintain consistent interpretation.|Consistent interpretation and tracking
Because these measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely reporting of defects and other dynamic measurements to keep the information current.|Timely defect and data reporting

Different attributes of the software artifacts may be treated as an unstructured heap of symbols (for example, raw count such as LOCline of code), or as syntactical structures (for example, various control flow path measurements (Fenton and Pfleeger, 1996)), or even as interconnected semantic entities (for example, context-sensitive measures such as live data definitions (Tai, 1984)).|Measurement of structures

The most commonly used form of multiple checklists is | the hierarchical checklist

One of the important characteristics of these checklists is that |they are typically not veryspecific, particularly those high-level ones

It would be hard to come up with checklists that cover all the functional (black-box) or structural (white-box) components| from different perspectives and at different levels
a lot of overlaps between different items in the checklists may be introduced, resulting in redundant testing effort when such checklists are used.

the actual testing is typically performed late in the overall product development process,| and the model construction could be and should be started much earlier
the operational profiles (OPs) need to be | constructed with customer and user input
testing according to customer usage scenarios and frequencies captured in OPs cannot be | performed until most of the product components have been implemented
each operation corresponds to an individual sub-domain | in domain partitions, thus representing a whole equivalence class
It is customary to sort the operations by descending | probabilities of usage and present the results in that order
It is common to have quite uneven distribution of usage probabilities, with a | few frequently used ones account for most of the usage frequencies
if some operations have very low probability of usage,| we could omit them in the OP
it can be used to support statistical testing by some random sampling procedure to | select test cases according to the probability distribution and execute them
each operation in the OP corresponds to certain test cases specifically constructed or| selected from existing ones to specifically test this system operation
Productivity improvement and schedule gains could be achieved because of | the focus on high-leverage parts with the use of OPs
Introducing new products by implementing highly used features quickly to capture market share | and then gradually adding lesser-used features in subsequent releases or product updates
The use of OPs can foster better communications with | target customers and help establish and maintain better customer relations
The use of OPs can help develop more precise product requirements and specifications, | which are more likely to satisfy customers’ needs
Customer and user training can be better focused on those features that the customers | use the most instead of esoteric ones more likely to be used by internal users
The exact way used to handle defects is also influenced by | the specific QA activities that led to their initial discovery, the project environment, and other factors
The most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution, which ensures that each discovered defect is |corrected or taken care of through appropriate actions.
Each corrected or fixed defect needs to be re-verified to ensure failure-free executions | under the same execution conditions
Defect logging | or the initial reporting and recording of a discovered defect This  ensures that a record will be kept for every discovered defect
Defect tracking | which monitors and records what happened to each defect after its initial discovery, up until its final resolution
Consistent defect interpretation and tracking | We need to distinguish execution failures,internal faults, and human errors. The specific problems need to be counted andtracked consistently
Timely defect reporting | Because defect measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely defect reporting to keep the information current
The exception is | unit testing, which is usually carried out parallel to coding by the same person
Most defects from unit testing are not | formally tracked because they are considered as part of the implementation activities
Defect handling is implicitly assumed to be part of the project  | management activities, which is handled in similar ways as configuration management.
A formalized defect handling process highlights important | activities and associated rules,parties involved, and their responsibilities. 
It is typically defined by the differentstates |  associated with individual defect status and transitions among these states due to status changes
Different defect handling processes may include | different collections of defect status and other possible attributes.
Defect handling is not closely associated with |  defect prevention.
The focus is not on the discovery of underlying faults that cause | failures and possible accidents
Defect information can be used | as additional input
Among the different QA activities, defect containment activities play | an important role in post-release product operations and maintenance support
Repeated use of recovery blocks for the same situations may be an | indication of software problems instead of 
Most of the implementation activities need to be carried out | during software development, not after product release...
including defect prevention and defect reduction, are performed | during software development instead of during in-field software support after
A typical sequence includes, in chronological order: | product planning, requirement analysis,specification, design, coding, testing, release...
The error sources are typically associated with activities in these early phases, such as  | conceptual mistakes by designers and programmers,unfamiliarity with the product domain...
The vast majority of faults are  | injected in the early development phases, particularly in detailed design and implementation phases
failure prevention and containment activities, such as fault tolerance and safety assurance, | are typically the focus of operational phases
QA activities, typically inspections and reviews, carried out at the transitions | from one phase to the next are shown as barriers or gates to pass. 
The exception to this is between testing and release, where | the reviews are typically accompanied by acceptance testing
The general distribution scope is |shown by the dotted bracket, with a focus on defect prevention in the early phases, a focus on defect removal during coding and testing phases...
the overall process can be viewed as consisting of several | increments or iterations
integration testing plays a very important role, to make sure that | different parts can inter-operate seamlessly to fulfill the intended functionalities correctly together
System testing, where the focus is | the overall set of system functions to be provided to users
Usage-based statistical testing, where | the operational environment by target users is simulated during software testing before product release
Software fault tolerance, which focuses on | providing continued service expected by customers even when local problems exist
Software safety assurance activities, which focus on | providing the expected accidentfree operations or reducing accident damage when an accident is unavoidable
Software verification activities check | the conformance of a software system to its specifications
A deviation from the specification is either a fault or a failure, depending on | whether the behavior is specified or other software related entities are specific
failures are involved in verification activities, we are typically dealing with | internal system failures and overall system failures in the form of incorrect behavior
When a function or feature expected by the customers is present, the activity to determine | whether it performs or behaves expectedly is then a verification activity
When we are checking non-behavioral specifications, non-conformance indicates | the presence of faults or errors
Validation checks the conformance to quality expectations of customers and users in | the form of whether the expected functions or features are present or not
verification checks the conformance of software product implementation | against its specifications to see if it is implemented correctly
validation deals directly with users and their requirements  while | verification deals with internal product specifications
verification and validation activities may be distributed in | these different processes differently
A set of internal specifications needs to be | followed or other rules or criteria need to be satisfied
The satisfactory conformance of these specifications, designs, and rules is | the focus of various verification activities
various defect prevention activities are typically | concentrated in the earlier phases of software developmen
defect reduction is typically concentrated in | the middle to late phases of software developmen
defect containment activities are typically the focus of | operational phases, with its planning, design, and implementation carried out earlier during software development
Many specific QA activities deal with both |the verification and the validation aspects.
Defect prevention deals with error source elimination and error blocking, | while both verification and validation deal with failures and faults
The formal verification part naturally falls into verification activities, |verifying the program or design correctness with respect to its formal specifications 
fault tolerance and safety assurance, are more closely related to | validation activities than verification ...

structural testing focus on the internal implementation|while viewing the object to be tested as a white-box that allows us to see the contents inside
actual testing for large software systems is typically organized and divided into|various sub-phases starting from the coding phase up to post-release product support, including unit testing, component testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, beta testing
Unit testing and component testing typically focus on|individual program elements that are present in the unit or component
Functional testing verifies the correct handling of the external functions provided by the|software, through the observation of the program external behavior during execution
Perspective|BBT  views the objects of  testing  as a black-box while focusing on testing the input-output relations or external functional behavior; while WBT views the objects as a glass-box where internal implementation details are visible and tested
Objects|WBT is generally used to test small objects, such as small software products or small units of large software products
Timeline|WBT is used more in early sub-phases of testing for large software systems, such as unit and component testing
Defect focus|In BBT, failures related to specific external functions can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed

Quality planning drives|and should precede the other two groups of activities
The collective effort of selected QA activities|generally demonstrated the following pattern|gradual build-up process for individual QA activities
Quality Planning before specific QA activities are carried out|in the so-called pre-QA activities in software quality engineering
Quality quantization|and improvement through measurement, analysis, feedback,and follow-up activities
the biggest obstacle to formal methods|is the high cost associated with the difficult task of performing these human intensive activities correctly without adequate automated support
The question of applicability can be answered in two steps|The type of products or application domains that would benefit,..The type of software artifacts in the above products
The most commonly verified or analyzed objects| are the program code
The basic reason behind this is the shared formalism and formal language|that can be used to describe, model, and analyze different type of systems, not just limited
In terms of the software artifacts from different development phases being verified and analyze| these techniques are closely related to and depend upon the availability of formal system specifications, either as formal descriptions
Formal verification and analysis|is most closely related  to formal inspection, review, and static analysis
formal methods belong to the defect prevention category|with formal specifications eliminating certain error sources due to poor understanding of product requirements and formal verification confirming the absence of certain defects.
The use of recovery blocks|occasional failures only cause loss of partial computational results but not complete execution failures
Periodic checkpointing and refreshing to save the dynamic contents of software executions|Sometimes this activity can be associated with the completion of some major tasks or occurrence of some significant events, in addition to at the pre-determinedtime instances
Failure detection|This activity is typically associated with the checkpointing activity above
before a new checkpoint can be established|some consistency check is carried out to see if there is an execution failure or other suspected
If a failure is detected|1. Rollback by restoring the saved dynamic contents2. Rerun the lost computation.
In using recovery blocks, failures are detected|but the underlying faults are not removed
The limited capability for fault tolerance is achieved through fault avoidance|due to different execution path or execution condition that does not involve the fault code
Another issue is the maintenance and follow-up activities to normal operations|repeated failures need to be dealt with by taking the system off-line for defect analysis and fixing
Analysis of actual or potential accident scenarios|with a focus on preconditions, or hazards, for these scenarios This type of analysis is called hazard analysis
Preventive and remedial actions for accident prevention|referred to as hazard resolution, to deal with the hazards identified in the above analysis
Generic ways include hazard elimination|hazard reduction, and hazard control. 
The basic analysis tool is logical diagrams called fault-trees|which also represent the analysis results
The analysis follows a top-down procedure|starting with the top event and recursively analyzing each event or condition to find out its logical conditions or sub-conditions
An event tree|is a temporal cause-effect diagram We start with the primary event and follow through its subsequent events and consequences over time or stages
Each branch of the event tree|represents a specific consequence of a decision, which in turn can be associated with their own subsequent decisions and consequences
The main usage of ETA is to recreate accident sequences and/or scenarios|the critical paths that lead from the primary events through a sequence of decisions
Hazard elimination through substitution|simplification, decoupling, elimination of specific human errors, and reduction of hazardous materials or conditions
Hazard reduction through design for controllability|use of locking devices and failure probability minimization using safety margins and redundancy
Hazard control|through reducing exposure, isolation and containment protection system
damage control|also involves accident analysis that guide planned and actual strategies for damage control in the unfortunate event that accidents do happen
Detection or observation|of specific problems from specific defect perspectives during the performance of specific QA activities
Types of follow-up actions|that deal with the observed or detected problems in specific ways as examined from the defect perspectives
Defect prevention|works  to block some errors or to remove error sources to prevent the injection of related faults
One key difference between inspection and testing|is the way faults are identified
Inspection involves static examination| while testing involves dynamic executions
It is hard for human inspectors to keep track of multiple components and complicated interactions over time|while the same task may not be such a difficult one for computers
Human inspectors can focus on a small area and perform|in-depth analysis, leading to effective detection of localized faults
Formal verification|deals with logical (or mathematical) correctness, and can be interpreted as extremely formalized inspection
Fault tolerance and failure|containment are designed to work with dynamic operational problems that may lead to global failures and accidents
For existing products with relatively high defect levels or with many common faults|inspection is most likely to be more effective than testing
A proof of correctness of a formal verification|can only be produced if the program is fault-free with respect to its formal specification
When verification cannot be successfully|further analysis can often reveal accidental logical or functional faults
Fault tolerance techniques|generally involve the observations of dynamic local failures failures and the tolerance of the related faults but not the identification and removal of these faults
Most traditional QA activities|such as testing and inspection, focus on defect detection and removal
Operational cost of having specific mechanisms|in the operational systems, which may slow down the overall system, reduce the system capacity, or negatively affect other performance measures
Implementation cost to design|implement, and ensure selected features and mechanisms, such as backups and redundancies
Failure or accident cost|which is similar to the dormant defect cost considered above for defect prevention and defect reduction techniques
Among the three, failure/accident|cost need to be balanced against the other two to justify  spending valuable resources to implement and operate these fault tolerance 
active design reviews (ADR) to ensure inspectors’ active participation, | the author prepares questionnaires to focus on specific scenarios or areas
these analyses can be used in testing or other QA activities |  Decision table and decision tree analyses,Boundary value analysis is related to testing,Finite-state machine analysis is most closely related,ontrol flow and data dependency analyses

The basic idea of domain testing | to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain
to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain | called domain analysis, or input domain analysis
There are several important characteristics for this testing technique | It tests  UO  (inputloutput) relations by providing input values associated with all the individual input variables.The output variable values are not explicitly specified.  But, we assume that there are ways to check if the expected output is obtained for any given input.
The input domain consists of all the points representing  all the allowable | input com-binations  specified for the program  in the product specification. 
An input sub-domain is a subset of the input domain.  In general,  a sub-domain can be defined by a set of inequalities  in the form of | f(x1,x2,...xn)< K ,
A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains | A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains
A boundary  is where  two sub-domains meet.  When inequalities  are used  to define sub-domains as above, the following equation would give us a specific boundary: |  f(x1,x2,...xn) = K ,
A boundary is a linear boundary if  it is defined by | a1x1+ a2x2+...+anxn = K 
 If a sub-domain whose boundaries  are all  linear  one |  it  is called  a linear sub-domain
A point on a boundary  is called | a boundary point
if all the boundary points belong to the sub-domain | A boundary  is a closed one with respect to a specific sub-domain
if  none of  the boundary  points belong to the sub-domain | A  boundary  is  an  open one  with  respect  to  a  specific  sub-domain
the specific variations  of domain testing depend on | how this third step is carried out
The simplest strategy is | to sample one test  point  from inside each sub-domain in  the partition,  thus  achieving complete coverage of  all  the  sub-domains
Most of such cases indicate problems in the product pecification or in the implementation | which result in different output for the same input or  the system behaves incorrectly 
The most common situations for this kind of problems to occur is | when computational procedures  are defined for individual sub-domains
the problem with whether the boundary points belong to this sub-domain under consideration | Closureproblem
 problem refers to the disagreement with where exactly a boundary is between the intended and the actual boundary | Boundary shift
If a  boundary  is missing, that means the two neighboring sub-domains will collapse into one subdomain | Missing  boundary
Extreme-point combination |  one of the oldest domain testing strategies that are still used by people and supported by some testing tools
uses n ON points and  1  OFF points  to be defined below for each boundary | Weak N  X  1 strategy
In an n-dimensional space, a boundary defined by an equation in the form of  | f(x~,xi!, *. .yxn) = K 
If  the  boundary  is  a  closed  boundary with  respect  to  the  sub-domain under consideration | the OFF point will be outside the sub-domain or be an exterior point. 
If  the boundary  is  an  open  boundary  with  respect  to  the  sub-domain  under consideration | the OFF point  will  be  inside the sub-domain or be an  interior point
An extra boundary would likely  | to cause some of these IN points to receive different processing if  it separates them  apart
in  the two-dimensional space, it should be chosen by | Choosing the midpoint between the two ON points, Then  moving  6  distance off  the  boundary,  outward  or  inward  for 
boundary problems are considered below | Extra boundaly,Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
With extra boundary, more ON points would enhance the possibility that the extra boundary  | Extra boundaly
When boundary tilt or general boundary change  is concerned | Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
For nonlinear boundaries | n points are not enough to define the boundary
Other types of  boundaries and extensions  | Limits or boundaries associated ,The ideas  can be  used  for capacity  testing

The basic  idea of  FSMs |  use an  intermediate formalism to  model the program exe-cution or behavior that strikes

Transition problems | missing, extra, or incorrect transitions; 
Transition problems : missing, extra, or incorrect transitions | A missing transition  is one,An extra transition  is associated,An incorrect transition is a transition
Input problems | In FSM-based testihg,  we typically treat
construct FSMs and validate them in the following steps | 1.Information source ,2.Construction of initial FSMs
State identification and enumeration | We need to keep the number of states to a manageable level
Transition identification with the help of input values | For each state, we can consider all the possible transitions in connection with
The basic  idea for identifying missing states or transitions is | similar to checklist- and partition-based testing. For example, a checklist based on produ
Checking for extra states and transitions can follow | essentially the same procedure by cross-validating them  with  the information sources
In  trying to reach a specific state, each test case is | essentially a series of  input values that enables us to make
From the current state, the next state to visit | determined by the input. 
Test case sensitization for FSM-based testing is | fairly easy and straightforward
Since each transition is | associated with specific input values, we can simply select such input values to sensitize the test case.
 FSM-modeled systems | input and output are associated with individual transitions instead of as an indistinguishable lump of  initial input for many other systems
FSM-based testing  | generally  suitable for systems with  clearly identifiable  states and state transitions.
FSM-based testing has |  received significant attention is the testing of object-oriented  software and systems
The primary  limitation  of FSM-based  testing is | its  inability to handle large number of states.

For DFT, test preparation includes the following steps: | Build and verify the DDGs>Define and  select data slices to cover>Sensitize the data slices or the test>Plan for result checking
the DDGs typically show the following characteristics | here is usually one output data item,There are typically more input variables and constants,Multiple inlinks are common,Since the DDG is typically shown
DFT is | more often white-box than black-box
such constructed DDGs is | the identification of variables in specifications or implementations

of the analysis technique has many ramifications. A simple technique is generally easy to understand, easy to use, easy (and lesscostly) to performon a given set of data, and is more likely to be supported by existing tools|Simplicity
plays an important role in model applications. A good understanding of the analysis results is a precondition to follow-up actions|Ease of result interpretation
also has a significant influence on the practical applications of specific techniques|Availability of tool support
the questionsasked during the analyses are similar|What?,Where?,When?,Pre- or post-release?,How and Why?
The identification and classification of the discovered defects can be performed to identify what they are and classify them by some consistent scheme. This topic is the focus of this chapter, which is discussed in all subsequent sections|What?
Where was the defect found or discovered? This information can be used to provide valuable feedback to the development process through defect distribution analysis|Where?
The identificationof the exact time or associated development phase or subphase when a defect is injected and when it is discovered is important, because it provides information to analyze the overall defect trend and serves as the basis for quality prediction into the future|When?
An important extension to the “when” question is whether a defect is a pre-release defect or a post-release defect, sometimes labeled as an indevelopment(or in-process)or an in-field defect, respectively|Pre- or post-release?
How was the defect injected into the software,and why? These two questions are closely related, both pertaining to the cause of the discovered defects|How and Why?

If the information about defect injection time is available,it can be used to augmentthe defect removal models into the so called|defect dynamics model
Defect causal analysis can usually take two forms|logical analysis and statistical analysis.
a deterministic analysis that examinesthe logical link between the effects and the corresponding causes, and establishes general causal relations|Logical analysis
a probabilistic analysis that examines the statistical link between causes and effects and deduces the probable causal relations between the two|Statistical analysis
can be either the observed failures or discovered (or fixed) faults, and the corresponding causes are the faults that caused the failures or the errors that caused the injection of the faults, respectively|The effects in the defect causal analysis

The information, providedby testers at defect discovery, includes|impact,trigger, severity,week
based on the answers to the question: “If this defect is not fixed, how will it impact the customer?’ Pre-defined impact categories (possible answers) include performance, reliability,etc.|Defect impact
categories closely resemble test scenario classes used for managing the testing process for this product. |Defect trigger

help both developers and testers to detect and remove potential defects, and help other project personnel to improve the development process, to prevent injection of similar defects, and to manage risk better by planning early for product support and services|Analyses ofdiscovered defects and related information 
can help us obtain an objective assessment of our current product quality, in contrast to the often unreliable subjective assessment based on personal judgment or imprecise qualitative assessment|MODELS FOR QUALITY ASSESSMENT
We define quality assessment models as analytical models that provide quantitative assessment of selected quality characteristics or sub-characteristics based on|measurement data from software projects
the correctness aspect of quality can be measured and derived ___ from its definitions|directly
we also need to monitor these ____ quality measurements and analyze them using various quality assessment models, so that we can assure and improve quality by controlling these indirect entities, particularly in the early part of software development process|indirect
Depending on whether product-specific measurements and results are used and provided, we can classify existing quality assessment models into two broad categories|generalized models and product-speciJicmodels 
compared by looking at their ability to provide useful information, their applicability to different project environments, and their inter-connections|Different types of quality assessment models and their relations
_____of the modeling results, in terms of how _____ the quality estimates
are and the _______ of the models to different environments.|Usefulness,accurate,applicability
Model inter-connections,which can be examined in two opposite directions|Customizution,Generalization
of generalized quality models to provide better quality estimates when product-specific information is available.|Customizution
of product-specific models when enough empirical evidence from different products or projects is accumulated.|Generalization
Decisions without explicit quality assessment|Implicit,Indirect,Otherfactors
such as completion of planned test activities, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly assumes the effectiveness of the testing activities|Implicit quality assessments
such as achieving certain test coverage goals, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly equates coverage levels to reliability levels.|Indirect quality assessments
such asproject schedule, cost, and resource utilization, can sometimes be used as exit criteria.|Otherfactors
Decisions based on explicit quality assessments|Failure-related, Fault-related
from a customer’sor external perspective, such as various reliability measures and impact assessments|Failure-related quality assessments
from a developer’s or internal perspective,such as defect density and count estimates for latent defects.|Fault-related quality assessments  
This decision is probably the one most closely identified with product release or phasehb-phase termination decisions. When there is a mismatch between a product’s quality progress and project schedule, adjustment is called for. The quality assessment results typically will indicate when the quality goal will be satisfied. This input can be used to delay (more often) or speed up (less often) the project schedule.|Schedule adjustment
Similar to the above, if a project is behind schedule or ahead of schedule, resource allocation decisions may be made to try to compensate for it by adding or removing certain resources, although the impact of this is limited (Brooks, 1995). | Resource allocation and adjustment
Sometimes, product release decisions are made regardless of the current quality level.|Planning for post-release product support
can be based on an assessment of quality strength and weakness of the current product, or a comparison between this and othercompetitive products| Planning forfuture products 
The follow-upand improvement can be concentratedin three major areas|Futureproduct, Process,people quality improvement
This is similar to the above feedbackand followup activities,but with the added hindsight. Better quality planning can be formulated based on the experience of the current project, both in terms of goal setting and the selectionof the overall QA strategies. |Futureproduct quality improvement 
This improvement can be achievedin two generalareas, the quality engineering process itself and the general software engineering process. The former can be based on the experience with carrying out the current quality engineering process, while the latter would also benefit greatly from alternativeexperience using other development processes to develop similar products|Processquality improvement
A more intangible benefit is the experience gained by
people in many areas, including domain knowledgeof the specific product, software process and technology experience, and quality engineering knowledge. Their experience can be packaged to ensure effective transfer of the collective knowledge and experience, or the so-called institutional memory, to new project personnel.|People quality improvement
the correctness aspect of quality can often be ____ derived from its definition or related to various defect measurements. |directly
To ensure proper collection and usage of various measurement data, we need to pay special attention to the following| Consistent interpretation and tracking,Timely defect and data reporting,Proper data granularity
For defects, we need to distinguish execution failures, internal faults, and errors in human actions. The specific problems need to be counted and tracked consistently. Similarly, other measurements also require us to maintain consistent interpretation.|Consistent interpretation and tracking
Because these measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely reporting of defects and other dynamic measurements to keep the information current.|Timely defect and data reporting
Different quality analyses and models might require data at different levels of granularity. We will examine this aspect further in connection with models for quality assessment and improvement in Chapter 19|Proper data granularity
the process used|Theprocess characteristicsinclude
activities and their relationships|Theprocess characteristicsinclude

being measured, including control (for example, control flow paths), data (for example, operand count), and presentation (for example,different indentation rules used).|Product (internal)attributes
Different attributes of the software artifacts may be treated as an unstructured heap of symbols (for example, raw count such as LOCline of code), or as syntactical structures (for example, various control flow path measurements (Fenton and Pfleeger, 1996)), or even as interconnected semantic entities (for example, context-sensitive measures such as live data definitions (Tai, 1984)).|Measurement of structures
_____ directly measure specific software development and maintenance activities and the associated effort, time, and other resources. |Activity measurements
activity measurements for the whole project. For example, total effort and cycle-time can be used in various models for overall quality assessment and project release decisions.|Coarse-grain
activity measurements for individual development phases, sub-phases, or time periods such as weeks or months. For example, defect profiles over development phases are commonly used in various models for quality assessment, resource allocation, and project managment.|Medium-grain
activity measurements for individual activities|Fine-grain
Functional (black-box) checklists at different levels of abstraction and granularity,| ranging from major high-level functions ...
Checklists of system elements (white-box) at different levels of granularity, | ranging from sub-systems and modules at the high level to individual 
Checklists about certain properties, such as coding standard, specific specification items, etc., which can be either black-box or white-box
A common way to obtain usable checklists is to | select items from several exhaustive checklists based on some criteria and to combine them
The most commonly used form of multiple checklists is | the hierarchical checklist
each item in a higher-level checklist expandable to a full checklist | at a lower level until we stop at a level of detail deemed enough by some criteria
One of the important characteristics of these checklists is that |they are typically not veryspecific, particularly those high-level ones
the increased demand for more automation, service, and functionality, modern software systems | also become larger and more complex
It would be hard to come up with checklists that cover all the functional (black-box) or structural (white-box) components| from different perspectives and at different levels
a lot of overlaps between different items in the checklists may be introduced, resulting in redundant testing effort when such checklists are used.
Some complex interactions of different system components or among major system functions are | hard or impossible to describe using checklists
this testing strategy directly corresponds to the checklist-based testing, with the domain partition as the checklist, and each sub-domain corresponding to a single element in the checklis
The subsets are mutually exclusive, that is,| no two subsets share any common member
The subsets are collectively exhaustive, that is, they collectively cover or include | all the elements in the original set
we simply select one item for testing at a time from the subset as a representative of the corresponding | equivalent class until we have exhausted all the subsets
if operations associated with one particular sub-domain are used more often than others, each underlying defect related to this sub-domain is also more likely to cause
The information related to usage scenarios, patterns, and related usage frequency| by target customers and users needs to be collected
Testing needs to be performed | in accordance with the OPs
Testing results can be analyzed to assess product reliability and provide feedback | to the testing and the general software development process
the actual testing is typically performed late in the overall product development process,| and the model construction could be and should be started much earlier
the operational profiles (OPs) need to be | constructed with customer and user input
testing according to customer usage scenarios and frequencies captured in OPs cannot be | performed until most of the product components have been implemented
each operation corresponds to an individual sub-domain | in domain partitions, thus representing a whole equivalence class
It is customary to sort the operations by descending | probabilities of usage and present the results in that order
It is common to have quite uneven distribution of usage probabilities, with a | few frequently used ones account for most of the usage frequencies
if some operations have very low probability of usage,| we could omit them in the OP
it can be used to support statistical testing by some random sampling procedure to | select test cases according to the probability distribution and execute them
each operation in the OP corresponds to certain test cases specifically constructed or| selected from existing ones to specifically test this system operation
Productivity improvement and schedule gains could be achieved because of | the focus on high-leverage parts with the use of OPs
Introducing new products by implementing highly used features quickly to capture market share | and then gradually adding lesser-used features in subsequent releases or product updates
The use of OPs can foster better communications with | target customers and help establish and maintain better customer relations
The use of OPs can help develop more precise product requirements and specifications, | which are more likely to satisfy customers’ needs
Customer and user training can be better focused on those features that the customers | use the most instead of esoteric ones more likely to be used by internal users
The exact way used to handle defects is also influenced by | the specific QA activities that led to their initial discovery, the project environment, and other factors
The most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution, which ensures that each discovered defect is |corrected or taken care of through appropriate actions.
Each corrected or fixed defect needs to be re-verified to ensure failure-free executions | under the same execution conditions
Defect logging | or the initial reporting and recording of a discovered defect This  ensures that a record will be kept for every discovered defect
Defect tracking | which monitors and records what happened to each defect after its initial discovery, up until its final resolution
Consistent defect interpretation and tracking | We need to distinguish execution failures,internal faults, and human errors. The specific problems need to be counted andtracked consistently
Timely defect reporting | Because defect measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely defect reporting to keep the information current
The exception is | unit testing, which is usually carried out parallel to coding by the same person
Most defects from unit testing are not | formally tracked because they are considered as part of the implementation activities
Defect handling is implicitly assumed to be part of the project  | management activities, which is handled in similar ways as configuration management.
A formalized defect handling process highlights important | activities and associated rules,parties involved, and their responsibilities. 
It is typically defined by the differentstates |  associated with individual defect status and transitions among these states due to status changes
Different defect handling processes may include | different collections of defect status and other possible attributes.
Defect handling is not closely associated with |  defect prevention.
The focus is not on the discovery of underlying faults that cause | failures and possible accidents
Defect information can be used | as additional input
Among the different QA activities, defect containment activities play | an important role in post-release product operations and maintenance support
Repeated use of recovery blocks for the same situations may be an | indication of software problems instead of 
Most of the implementation activities need to be carried out | during software development, not after product release...
including defect prevention and defect reduction, are performed | during software development instead of during in-field software support after
A typical sequence includes, in chronological order: | product planning, requirement analysis,specification, design, coding, testing, release...
The error sources are typically associated with activities in these early phases, such as  | conceptual mistakes by designers and programmers,unfamiliarity with the product domain...
The vast majority of faults are  | injected in the early development phases, particularly in detailed design and implementation phases
failure prevention and containment activities, such as fault tolerance and safety assurance, | are typically the focus of operational phases
QA activities, typically inspections and reviews, carried out at the transitions | from one phase to the next are shown as barriers or gates to pass. 
The exception to this is between testing and release, where | the reviews are typically accompanied by acceptance testing
The general distribution scope is |shown by the dotted bracket, with a focus on defect prevention in the early phases, a focus on defect removal during coding and testing phases...
the overall process can be viewed as consisting of several | increments or iterations
integration testing plays a very important role, to make sure that | different parts can inter-operate seamlessly to fulfill the intended functionalities correctly together
System testing, where the focus is | the overall set of system functions to be provided to users
Usage-based statistical testing, where | the operational environment by target users is simulated during software testing before product release
Software fault tolerance, which focuses on | providing continued service expected by customers even when local problems exist
Software safety assurance activities, which focus on | providing the expected accidentfree operations or reducing accident damage when an accident is unavoidable
Software verification activities check | the conformance of a software system to its specifications
A deviation from the specification is either a fault or a failure, depending on | whether the behavior is specified or other software related entities are specific
failures are involved in verification activities, we are typically dealing with | internal system failures and overall system failures in the form of incorrect behavior
When a function or feature expected by the customers is present, the activity to determine | whether it performs or behaves expectedly is then a verification activity
When we are checking non-behavioral specifications, non-conformance indicates | the presence of faults or errors
Validation checks the conformance to quality expectations of customers and users in | the form of whether the expected functions or features are present or not
verification checks the conformance of software product implementation | against its specifications to see if it is implemented correctly
validation deals directly with users and their requirements  while | verification deals with internal product specifications
verification and validation activities may be distributed in | these different processes differently
A set of internal specifications needs to be | followed or other rules or criteria need to be satisfied
The satisfactory conformance of these specifications, designs, and rules is | the focus of various verification activities
various defect prevention activities are typically | concentrated in the earlier phases of software developmen
defect reduction is typically concentrated in | the middle to late phases of software developmen
defect containment activities are typically the focus of | operational phases, with its planning, design, and implementation carried out earlier during software development
Many specific QA activities deal with both |the verification and the validation aspects.
Defect prevention deals with error source elimination and error blocking, | while both verification and validation deal with failures and faults
The formal verification part naturally falls into verification activities, |verifying the program or design correctness with respect to its formal specifications 
fault tolerance and safety assurance, are more closely related to | validation activities than verification ...

"demonstration of proper behavior" is a primary purpose of testing|which can also be interpreted as providing evidence of quality in the context of software QA, or as meeting certain quality goals
testing fulfills two primarypurposes|to demonstrate quality or proper behavior, to detect and fix problems
the major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order|Testplanning andpreparation,Test execution, Analysis and follow-up
Testplanning and preparation|which set the goals for testing, select an overall testing strategy, and prepare specific test cases and the general test procedure
Test execution|and related activities, which also include related observation and measurement of product behavior
Analysis and follow-up, which include result checking and analysis to determine if a failure has been observed|and if so, follow-up activities are initiated and monitored to ensure removal of the underlying causes, or faults, that led to the observed failures in the first place
The major test activities are centered around test execution|performing the actual tests. At a minimum, testing involves executing the software and communicating the related
One of the key component to effective test execution is the handling of problems to 
ensure that failed runs will not block|the executions of other test cases. This is particularly important for systems that require continuous operation
defect fixing is not considered to be a part of testing|but rather a part of the development activities
re-verification of problem fixes is considered as a part of testing|In this book, we consider all of these activities as a part of testing
Data captured during execution and other related measurements can be|used to locate and fix the underlying faults that led to the observed failure
After we have determined if a test run is a success|or failure, appropriate actions can be initiated for failed runs to locate and fix the underlying faults
Test planning and preparation include the following sub-activities:Goal setting,Test case preparation, Test procedure preparation
there is a strong need for planned, monitored, managed and optimized  testing  strategies|based on1 systematic considerations for  quality, formal models, and related techniques
Test case preparation|It includes constructing new test cases or generating them automatically, selecting from existing ones for legacy products
Test procedure preparation|For systematic testing on a large scale for most of today’s software products and software- intensive systems
Test procedure preparation| a formal procedure is more of a necessity than a luxury, It can be defined and followed to ensure effective test execution, problem handling and resolution, and the overall test process management
What artifacts are tested?|The primary types of objects or software artifacts to be tested are software programs or code written in different programming languages
What artifacts are tested|Program code is the focus of our testing effort and related testing techniques and activities
What to test, and what kind of  faults is found?|Black-box (or functional) testing verifies the correct handling of the external functions provided or supported by the software, or whether the observed behavior conforms to user expectations or product specifications
What to test, and what kind of  faults is found|White-box (or structural) testing verifies the correct implementation of internal units, structures, and relations among them
When black-box testing is performed|failures related to specific external functions can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed
The emphasis is on reducing the chances of encountering|functional problems by target customers
when white-box testing is performed|ailures related to internal implementations can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed
When, or at what defect level, to stop testing?|Most of the traditional testing techniques and testing sub-phases use some coverage information as the stopping criterion
When, or at what defect level, to stop testing|with the implicit assumption that higher coverage means higher quality or lower levels of defects
What is the spec$c  testing technique used|what-to-test and stopping-criteria
There are two basic types of models|hose based on simple structures such as checklists and partitions,and those based on finite-state machines(FSMs).
Some specialized extensions to the two basic models can be used to support several commonly|used testing techniques, such as input domain testing that extends partition  ideas to input sub-domains and focuses on testing related boundary conditions and control flow and data flow testing (CFT & DFT)  that extends FSMs
Who performs which specific activities?|Different people may be involved in different roles
When can specific test activities be performed?|Because testing is an execution-based QA activity, a prerequisite to actual testing is the existence of the implemented software units
actual testing of large software systems is typically organized|and divided into various sub-phases starting from the coding phase up to post-release
What is the product type or market segment for the product under testing|Most of the testing techniques we describe are generally applicable to most application domains
The main difference between functional and structural testing is the perspective and the related focus|Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components
Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components|while viewing the object to be tested as a black-box that prevents us from seeing the contents inside
structural testing focus on the internal implementation|while viewing the object to be tested as a white-box that allows us to see the contents inside
actual testing for large software systems is typically organized and divided into|various sub-phases starting from the coding phase up to post-release product support, including unit testing, component testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, beta testing
Unit testing and component testing typically focus on|individual program elements that are present in the unit or component
Functional testing verifies the correct handling of the external functions provided by the|software, through the observation of the program external behavior during execution
Perspective|BBT  views the objects of  testing  as a black-box while focusing on testing the input-output relations or external functional behavior; while WBT views the objects as a glass-box where internal implementation details are visible and tested
Objects|WBT is generally used to test small objects, such as small software products or small units of large software products
Timeline|WBT is used more in early sub-phases of testing for large software systems, such as unit and component testing
Defect focus|In BBT, failures related to specific external functions can be observed, leading to corresponding faults being detected and removed
Defect detection and fixing|Defects detected through WBT are easier to fix than those through BBT because of the direct connection between the observed failures and program units and implementation details in WBT
Techniques|Various techniques can be used to build models and generate test cases to perform systematic BBT
Resource-based criteria,The most commonly used such stopping criteria are|Stop when you run out of time.Stop when you run out of money
Activity-based criteria, commonly in the form|Stop when you complete planned test activities
Two primary types of usage models or OPs are|Flat OPs, or Musa OPs,Markov chain based usage models
Flat OPs, or Musa OPs|which present commonly used operations in a list, a histogram, or a tree-structure
Markov chain based usage models|which present commonly used operational units in Markov chains, where the state transition probabilities are history independent
The generic steps and major sub-activities for CBT model|Defining the model,Checking individual model elements,Dejning coverage criteria,Derive test cases
Defining the model|These models are often represented by some graphs, with individual  nodes representing the basic  model elements and links representing the interconnections
Checking individual model elements|to make sure the individual elements, such as links, nodes, and related properties, have been tested individually, typically in isolation
Defining coverage criteria|Besides covering the basic model elements above, some other coverage criteria are typically used to cover the overall execution and interactions
Derive test cases|Once the coverage criteria are defined, we can design our test cases to achieve them
Perspective: UBST views the objects of testing|from a user’s perspective and focuses 
on the usage scenarios, sequences, patterns, and associated frequencies or probabilities,while CBT views the objects from a developer’s 
Stopping criteria: UBST use product reliability|goals as the exit criterion; and CBT using coverage goals - surrogates or approximations of reliability goals
Usage-based vs. coverage-based stopping criteria and corresponding|testing techniques, with the former attempting to reach certain reliability goals by focusing on functions and feature frequently
Overall objectives and goals, which can be refined into specific|goals for specific testing. Some specific goals include reliability for usage-based statistical testing or coverage for various traditional testing techniques
Objects to be tested and the specific focus|Functional testing views the software product as a black-box and focuses on testing the external functional behavior
Information source identification and data collection| The information and data are generally affected by both what is required by specific models and what is available in the project environment
Analysis and initial model construction: The information|and data collected above are analyzed to construct testing models
Model validation and incremental improvement|This is an important step, particularly for large objects or for functions or usages associated with external customers
A test case|is a collection of entities and related information that allows a test to be executed or a test run to be performed
A test run|is a dynamic unit of specific test activities in the overall testing sequence on a selected testing object
Dependencies among individual test cases|Some test cases can only be run after others because one is used to set up another
Defect detection related sequencing|Many problems can only be effectively detected after others have been discovered and fixed
Sequences to  avoid accidents|For some systems,  possibly  severe problems and damages may incur during testing if certain areas were not checked through related test
Problem diagnosis related sequencing|Some execution problems observed during testing may involve complicated scenarios and many
Natural grouping of test cases|such as by functional and structural areas or by usage frequencies, can also be used for test sequencing and to manage parallel testing
General steps in test execution include|Allocating test time and resources,nvoking and running tests, and collecting execution information and measurements;Checking testing results and identifying system failures
Result checking, or the oracle problem|and the related failure identification is a difficult task, because of both the theoretical difficulties and practical limitations
Analysis of individual test runs includes|result checking and failure identification we covered in the previous section as part of the test execution activities
Problem diagnosis to examine|what kind of problem it is, where, when, and possible causes. This may involve analyzing the above records and using some diagnostic
Fault locating, to identify the exact location(s)|of fault(s) based on information from the previous steps and product knowledge
Defect Jixing, to fix the located fault(s) by adding|removing, or correcting certain parts of the code
Reliability  analysis for  usage-based testing|which can be used to assess  current product reliability and as input to determine if the pre-set reliability goal has been achieved
Coverage analysis for coverage-based testing|which can be used as a surrogate for reliability and used as the stopping criterion or as input to various decisions related to testing management
Overall  defect analysis|which can be used to examine defect distribution and to identify high-defect areas for focused remedial actions
vertical model would organize around a product|where dedicated people perform one or more testing tasks for the product.
horizontal model is used  in some large organizations|so that a testing team only performs one kind of testing for many different products within the organization
Various issues related to test automation include|specific needs and potential for autornation; selection of existing testing tools if available;possibility and cost of constructing specific test automation tools; availability of user training for these tools and time/effort needed;
McCabe Test from McCabe|and Associates provides control flow coverage related information and analysis. 
S-TCAT (System Test Coverage Analysis Tool) from SRI|provides function-level coverage and call-pair information
ATAC|from Telecodia is a data flow coverage analysis tool for white-box testing. 
Test planning and preparation|setting goal, sellecting overall strategies and techniques gathering information constructing testing modelspreparing individual test cases
Test execution and measurement|allocating and adjusting test time and resources,invoking and running tests, and taking appropriate measurements,checking testing results and identifying system failures.
Pre-QA activities| Quality planning:These are the activities that should be carried out before carrying out the regular QA activities
quantify these quality expectations to set appropriate quality goals in two steps|We need to select or define the quality measurements and models,We need to find out the expected values or ranges of the corresponding quality
The influence of quality perspectives and attributes|For different kinds of customers, users, and market segments, different QA alternatives might be appropriate
The influence of different quality Levels|Quantitative quality levels as specified in the quality goals may also affect the choice of appropriate QA techniques
Measurement: Besides defect measurements|collected during defect handling, which is typically carried out as part of the normal QA activities, various other measurements 
Analysis and modeling|These activities analyze measurement data from software projects and fit them  to analytical models that provide quantitative assessment of selected quality characteristics or sub-characteristics
Providing feedback and identifying improvement potentials|Results from the above analysis and modeling activities can provide feedback to the quality engineering process
Follow-up activities|Besides the immediate use of analysis and modeling results described above,various follow-up activities can be carried out to affect the long-term quality and organizational performance
The quality engineering process|forms an integral part of the overall software engineering process, where other concerns, such as cost and schedule, are also considered and managed
In alternative software processes other than waterfall|such as in incremental, iterative, spiral, and extreme programming processes
For normal project monitoring and management under any process|appropriate measurement activities need to be carried out to collect or extract data from the software process
Minor modifications|are needed to  integrate quality engineering activities into other development processes
Quality planning drives|and should precede the other two groups of activities
The collective effort of selected QA activities|generally demonstrated the following pattern|gradual build-up process for individual QA activities
Quality Planning before specific QA activities are carried out|in the so-called pre-QA activities in software quality engineering
Quality quantization|and improvement through measurement, analysis, feedback,and follow-up activities
the biggest obstacle to formal methods|is the high cost associated with the difficult task of performing these human intensive activities correctly without adequate automated support
The question of applicability can be answered in two steps|The type of products or application domains that would benefit,..The type of software artifacts in the above products
The most commonly verified or analyzed objects| are the program code
The basic reason behind this is the shared formalism and formal language|that can be used to describe, model, and analyze different type of systems, not just limited
In terms of the software artifacts from different development phases being verified and analyze| these techniques are closely related to and depend upon the availability of formal system specifications, either as formal descriptions
Formal verification and analysis|is most closely related  to formal inspection, review, and static analysis
formal methods belong to the defect prevention category|with formal specifications eliminating certain error sources due to poor understanding of product requirements and formal verification confirming the absence of certain defects.
The use of recovery blocks|occasional failures only cause loss of partial computational results but not complete execution failures
Periodic checkpointing and refreshing to save the dynamic contents of software executions|Sometimes this activity can be associated with the completion of some major tasks or occurrence of some significant events, in addition to at the pre-determinedtime instances
Failure detection|This activity is typically associated with the checkpointing activity above
before a new checkpoint can be established|some consistency check is carried out to see if there is an execution failure or other suspected
If a failure is detected|1. Rollback by restoring the saved dynamic contents2. Rerun the lost computation.
In using recovery blocks, failures are detected|but the underlying faults are not removed
The limited capability for fault tolerance is achieved through fault avoidance|due to different execution path or execution condition that does not involve the fault code
Another issue is the maintenance and follow-up activities to normal operations|repeated failures need to be dealt with by taking the system off-line for defect analysis and fixing
Analysis of actual or potential accident scenarios|with a focus on preconditions, or hazards, for these scenarios This type of analysis is called hazard analysis
Preventive and remedial actions for accident prevention|referred to as hazard resolution, to deal with the hazards identified in the above analysis
Generic ways include hazard elimination|hazard reduction, and hazard control. 
The basic analysis tool is logical diagrams called fault-trees|which also represent the analysis results
The analysis follows a top-down procedure|starting with the top event and recursively analyzing each event or condition to find out its logical conditions or sub-conditions
An event tree|is a temporal cause-effect diagram We start with the primary event and follow through its subsequent events and consequences over time or stages
Each branch of the event tree|represents a specific consequence of a decision, which in turn can be associated with their own subsequent decisions and consequences
The main usage of ETA is to recreate accident sequences and/or scenarios|the critical paths that lead from the primary events through a sequence of decisions
Hazard elimination through substitution|simplification, decoupling, elimination of specific human errors, and reduction of hazardous materials or conditions
Hazard reduction through design for controllability|use of locking devices and failure probability minimization using safety margins and redundancy
Hazard control|through reducing exposure, isolation and containment protection system
damage control|also involves accident analysis that guide planned and actual strategies for damage control in the unfortunate event that accidents do happen
Detection or observation|of specific problems from specific defect perspectives during the performance of specific QA activities
Types of follow-up actions|that deal with the observed or detected problems in specific ways as examined from the defect perspectives
Defect prevention|works  to block some errors or to remove error sources to prevent the injection of related faults
One key difference between inspection and testing|is the way faults are identified
Inspection involves static examination| while testing involves dynamic executions
It is hard for human inspectors to keep track of multiple components and complicated interactions over time|while the same task may not be such a difficult one for computers
Human inspectors can focus on a small area and perform|in-depth analysis, leading to effective detection of localized faults
Formal verification|deals with logical (or mathematical) correctness, and can be interpreted as extremely formalized inspection
Fault tolerance and failure|containment are designed to work with dynamic operational problems that may lead to global failures and accidents
For existing products with relatively high defect levels or with many common faults|inspection is most likely to be more effective than testing
A proof of correctness of a formal verification|can only be produced if the program is fault-free with respect to its formal specification
When verification cannot be successfully|further analysis can often reveal accidental logical or functional faults
Fault tolerance techniques|generally involve the observations of dynamic local failures failures and the tolerance of the related faults but not the identification and removal of these faults
Most traditional QA activities|such as testing and inspection, focus on defect detection and removal
Operational cost of having specific mechanisms|in the operational systems, which may slow down the overall system, reduce the system capacity, or negatively affect other performance measures
Implementation cost to design|implement, and ensure selected features and mechanisms, such as backups and redundancies
Failure or accident cost|which is similar to the dormant defect cost considered above for defect prevention and defect reduction techniques
Among the three, failure/accident|cost need to be balanced against the other two to justify  spending valuable resources to implement and operate these fault tolerance 
active design reviews (ADR) to ensure inspectors’ active participation, | the author prepares questionnaires to focus on specific scenarios or areas
these analyses can be used in testing or other QA activities |  Decision table and decision tree analyses,Boundary value analysis is related to testing,Finite-state machine analysis is most closely related,ontrol flow and data dependency analyses
The basic idea of domain testing | to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain
to generate test cases by assigning specific  values to input variables based on some analyses of the input domain | called domain analysis, or input domain analysis
There are several important characteristics for this testing technique | It tests  UO  (inputloutput) relations by providing input values associated with all the individual input variables.The output variable values are not explicitly specified.  But, we assume that there are ways to check if the expected output is obtained for any given input.
The input domain consists of all the points representing  all the allowable | input com-binations  specified for the program  in the product specification. 
An input sub-domain is a subset of the input domain.  In general,  a sub-domain can be defined by a set of inequalities  in the form of | f(x1,x2,...xn)< K ,
A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains | A domain partition, or input domain partition,  is a partition  of the input domain into a number of  sub-domains
A boundary  is where  two sub-domains meet.  When inequalities  are used  to define sub-domains as above, the following equation would give us a specific boundary: |  f(x1,x2,...xn) = K ,
A boundary is a linear boundary if  it is defined by | a1x1+ a2x2+...+anxn = K 
 If a sub-domain whose boundaries  are all  linear  one |  it  is called  a linear sub-domain
A point on a boundary  is called | a boundary point
if all the boundary points belong to the sub-domain | A boundary  is a closed one with respect to a specific sub-domain
if  none of  the boundary  points belong to the sub-domain | A  boundary  is  an  open one  with  respect  to  a  specific  sub-domain
the specific variations  of domain testing depend on | how this third step is carried out
The simplest strategy is | to sample one test  point  from inside each sub-domain in  the partition,  thus  achieving complete coverage of  all  the  sub-domains
Most of such cases indicate problems in the product pecification or in the implementation | which result in different output for the same input or  the system behaves incorrectly 
The most common situations for this kind of problems to occur is | when computational procedures  are defined for individual sub-domains
the problem with whether the boundary points belong to this sub-domain under consideration | Closureproblem
 problem refers to the disagreement with where exactly a boundary is between the intended and the actual boundary | Boundary shift
If a  boundary  is missing, that means the two neighboring sub-domains will collapse into one subdomain | Missing  boundary
Extreme-point combination |  one of the oldest domain testing strategies that are still used by people and supported by some testing tools
uses n ON points and  1  OFF points  to be defined below for each boundary | Weak N  X  1 strategy
In an n-dimensional space, a boundary defined by an equation in the form of  | f(x~,xi!, *. .yxn) = K 
If  the  boundary  is  a  closed  boundary with  respect  to  the  sub-domain under consideration | the OFF point will be outside the sub-domain or be an exterior point. 
If  the boundary  is  an  open  boundary  with  respect  to  the  sub-domain  under consideration | the OFF point  will  be  inside the sub-domain or be an  interior point
An extra boundary would likely  | to cause some of these IN points to receive different processing if  it separates them  apart
in  the two-dimensional space, it should be chosen by | Choosing the midpoint between the two ON points, Then  moving  6  distance off  the  boundary,  outward  or  inward  for 
boundary problems are considered below | Extra boundaly,Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
With extra boundary, more ON points would enhance the possibility that the extra boundary  | Extra boundaly
When boundary tilt or general boundary change  is concerned | Boundaly tilt and other boundary changes
For nonlinear boundaries | n points are not enough to define the boundary
Other types of  boundaries and extensions  | Limits or boundaries associated ,The ideas  can be  used  for capacity  testing

 the following sub-cases are tested | When the queue is empty,he cases with  1 or 2 elements already in...

The basic  idea of  FSMs |  use an  intermediate formalism to  model the program exe-cution or behavior that strikes
Some of  the basic  assumptions in those extensions include: | here is a finite number of stages or lists,Each stage or list is unique, that is, no stage or list ,The final choices made through multiple stages or lists are uni

The subset of  dynamic elements includes the input  provided to the FSMs and the output generated | Dynamic  elements

Transition problems | missing, extra, or incorrect transitions; 
Transition problems : missing, extra, or incorrect transitions | A missing transition  is one,An extra transition  is associated,An incorrect transition is a transition
Input problems | In FSM-based testihg,  we typically treat
construct FSMs and validate them in the following steps | 1.Information source ,2.Construction of initial FSMs
State identification and enumeration | We need to keep the number of states to a manageable level
Transition identification with the help of input values | For each state, we can consider all the possible transitions in connection with
The basic  idea for identifying missing states or transitions is | similar to checklist- and partition-based testing. For example, a checklist based on produ
Checking for extra states and transitions can follow | essentially the same procedure by cross-validating them  with  the information sources
In  trying to reach a specific state, each test case is | essentially a series of  input values that enables us to make
From the current state, the next state to visit | determined by the input. 
Test case sensitization for FSM-based testing is | fairly easy and straightforward
Since each transition is | associated with specific input values, we can simply select such input values to sensitize the test case.
 FSM-modeled systems | input and output are associated with individual transitions instead of as an indistinguishable lump of  initial input for many other systems
FSM-based testing  | generally  suitable for systems with  clearly identifiable  states and state transitions.
FSM-based testing has |  received significant attention is the testing of object-oriented  software and systems
The primary  limitation  of FSM-based  testing is | its  inability to handle large number of states.  
Client - Web Browsers 
Multi-layered web applications  | Web Server >Middleware> Database - Backend 
Traditional menu-driven software usually | separates its navigation from its computation; while the two are tightly mingled for web-based applications

Another  significant difference | the qualitative difference in  the  huge  number of navigational pages

This model also includes a predictive element, enabling the user of this model to estimate model parameters from product and process characteristics even before actual failures are|observed
can be estimated by the slope ofthe fitted SRGMs, and overall reliability change (or reliability growth due to failure observations and fault removals) can be characterized by the slope change from the beginning of testing to the current time|Using SRGMs, product reliability at a given time
Test run data over time can be easily collected (Section 22.6), consistently used to track testing progress, and can lead to accurate reliability assessments with SRGMs if runs are homogeneous|Many uses oftest run counts
For large software systems studied here, becausemany test runs involve little execution and much setup and manual operations, SRGMs fitted to execution time data do not perform well|Limited applicability of execution time
When run homogeneity cannot be assured, detailed usage measurements, such as measured by transactions, can be used effectively for reliability analyses with SRGMs|Using transactions
These results and related studies of other products or systems (Tian et al., 1995; Tian, 1995; Tian and Palma, 1997; Tian et al., 2004) point to several important conclusions, including|Many uses oftest run counts,Limited applicability of execution time,Using transactions

Where was the defect found or discovered? This information can be used to provide valuable feedback to the development process through defect distribution analysis|Where?
The identificationof the exact time or associated development phase or subphase when a defect is injected and when it is discovered is important, because it provides information to analyze the overall defect trend and serves as the basis for quality prediction into the future|When?
An important extension to the “when” question is whether a defect is a pre-release defect or a post-release defect, sometimes labeled as an indevelopment(or in-process)or an in-field defect, respectively|Pre- or post-release?
How was the defect injected into the software,and why? These two questions are closely related, both pertaining to the cause of the discovered defects|How and Why?

such as achieving certain test coverage goals, can be used as exit criteria, which implicitly equates coverage levels to reliability levels.|Indirect quality assessments
such asproject schedule, cost, and resource utilization, can sometimes be used as exit criteria.|Otherfactors
Decisions based on explicit quality assessments|Failure-related, Fault-related
from a customer’sor external perspective, such as various reliability measures and impact assessments|Failure-related quality assessments
from a developer’s or internal perspective,such as defect density and count estimates for latent defects.|Fault-related quality assessments  
This decision is probably the one most closely identified with product release or phasehb-phase termination decisions. When there is a mismatch between a product’s quality progress and project schedule, adjustment is called for. The quality assessment results typically will indicate when the quality goal will be satisfied. This input can be used to delay (more often) or speed up (less often) the project schedule.|Schedule adjustment
Similar to the above, if a project is behind schedule or ahead of schedule, resource allocation decisions may be made to try to compensate for it by adding or removing certain resources, although the impact of this is limited (Brooks, 1995). | Resource allocation and adjustment
Sometimes, product release decisions are made regardless of the current quality level.|Planning for post-release product support
can be based on an assessment of quality strength and weakness of the current product, or a comparison between this and othercompetitive products| Planning forfuture products 
The follow-upand improvement can be concentratedin three major areas|Futureproduct, Process,people quality improvement
This is similar to the above feedbackand followup activities,but with the added hindsight. Better quality planning can be formulated based on the experience of the current project, both in terms of goal setting and the selectionof the overall QA strategies. |Futureproduct quality improvement 
This improvement can be achievedin two generalareas, the quality engineering process itself and the general software engineering process. The former can be based on the experience with carrying out the current quality engineering process, while the latter would also benefit greatly from alternativeexperience using other development processes to develop similar products|Processquality improvement
A more intangible benefit is the experience gained by
people in many areas, including domain knowledgeof the specific product, software process and technology experience, and quality engineering knowledge. Their experience can be packaged to ensure effective transfer of the collective knowledge and experience, or the so-called institutional memory, to new project personnel.|People quality improvement
the correctness aspect of quality can often be ____ derived from its definition or related to various defect measurements. |directly
To ensure proper collection and usage of various measurement data, we need to pay special attention to the following| Consistent interpretation and tracking,Timely defect and data reporting,Proper data granularity
For defects, we need to distinguish execution failures, internal faults, and errors in human actions. The specific problems need to be counted and tracked consistently. Similarly, other measurements also require us to maintain consistent interpretation.|Consistent interpretation and tracking
Because these measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely reporting of defects and other dynamic measurements to keep the information current.|Timely defect and data reporting
Different quality analyses and models might require data at different levels of granularity. We will examine this aspect further in connection with models for quality assessment and improvement in Chapter 19|Proper data granularity
the process used|Theprocess characteristicsinclude

being measured, including software requirement specifications, designs, program code, test cases, related documents, and other softwareartifacts.|Sofhyare artifacts 
being measured, including control (for example, control flow paths), data (for example, operand count), and presentation (for example,different indentation rules used).|Product (internal)attributes
Different attributes of the software artifacts may be treated as an unstructured heap of symbols (for example, raw count such as LOCline of code), or as syntactical structures (for example, various control flow path measurements (Fenton and Pfleeger, 1996)), or even as interconnected semantic entities (for example, context-sensitive measures such as live data definitions (Tai, 1984)).|Measurement of structures
_____ directly measure specific software development and maintenance activities and the associated effort, time, and other resources. |Activity measurements
activity measurements for the whole project. For example, total effort and cycle-time can be used in various models for overall quality assessment and project release decisions.|Coarse-grain
activity measurements for individual development phases, sub-phases, or time periods such as weeks or months. For example, defect profiles over development phases are commonly used in various models for quality assessment, resource allocation, and project managment.|Medium-grain
activity measurements for individual activities|Fine-grain
Functional (black-box) checklists at different levels of abstraction and granularity,| ranging from major high-level functions ...
Checklists of system elements (white-box) at different levels of granularity, | ranging from sub-systems and modules at the high level to individual 
Checklists about certain properties, such as coding standard, specific specification items, etc., which can be either black-box or white-box
A common way to obtain usable checklists is to | select items from several exhaustive checklists based on some criteria and to combine them
The most commonly used form of multiple checklists is | the hierarchical checklist
each item in a higher-level checklist expandable to a full checklist | at a lower level until we stop at a level of detail deemed enough by some criteria
One of the important characteristics of these checklists is that |they are typically not veryspecific, particularly those high-level ones
the increased demand for more automation, service, and functionality, modern software systems | also become larger and more complex
It would be hard to come up with checklists that cover all the functional (black-box) or structural (white-box) components| from different perspectives and at different levels
a lot of overlaps between different items in the checklists may be introduced, resulting in redundant testing effort when such checklists are used.
Some complex interactions of different system components or among major system functions are | hard or impossible to describe using checklists
this testing strategy directly corresponds to the checklist-based testing, with the domain partition as the checklist, and each sub-domain corresponding to a single element in the checklis
The subsets are mutually exclusive, that is,| no two subsets share any common member
The subsets are collectively exhaustive, that is, they collectively cover or include | all the elements in the original set
we simply select one item for testing at a time from the subset as a representative of the corresponding | equivalent class until we have exhausted all the subsets
if operations associated with one particular sub-domain are used more often than others, each underlying defect related to this sub-domain is also more likely to cause
The information related to usage scenarios, patterns, and related usage frequency| by target customers and users needs to be collected
Testing needs to be performed | in accordance with the OPs
Testing results can be analyzed to assess product reliability and provide feedback | to the testing and the general software development process
the actual testing is typically performed late in the overall product development process,| and the model construction could be and should be started much earlier
the operational profiles (OPs) need to be | constructed with customer and user input
testing according to customer usage scenarios and frequencies captured in OPs cannot be | performed until most of the product components have been implemented
each operation corresponds to an individual sub-domain | in domain partitions, thus representing a whole equivalence class
It is customary to sort the operations by descending | probabilities of usage and present the results in that order
It is common to have quite uneven distribution of usage probabilities, with a | few frequently used ones account for most of the usage frequencies
if some operations have very low probability of usage,| we could omit them in the OP
it can be used to support statistical testing by some random sampling procedure to | select test cases according to the probability distribution and execute them
each operation in the OP corresponds to certain test cases specifically constructed or| selected from existing ones to specifically test this system operation
Productivity improvement and schedule gains could be achieved because of | the focus on high-leverage parts with the use of OPs
Introducing new products by implementing highly used features quickly to capture market share | and then gradually adding lesser-used features in subsequent releases or product updates
The use of OPs can foster better communications with | target customers and help establish and maintain better customer relations
The use of OPs can help develop more precise product requirements and specifications, | which are more likely to satisfy customers’ needs
Customer and user training can be better focused on those features that the customers | use the most instead of esoteric ones more likely to be used by internal users
The exact way used to handle defects is also influenced by | the specific QA activities that led to their initial discovery, the project environment, and other factors
The most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution, which ensures that each discovered defect is |corrected or taken care of through appropriate actions.
Each corrected or fixed defect needs to be re-verified to ensure failure-free executions | under the same execution conditions
Defect logging | or the initial reporting and recording of a discovered defect This  ensures that a record will be kept for every discovered defect
Defect tracking | which monitors and records what happened to each defect after its initial discovery, up until its final resolution
Consistent defect interpretation and tracking | We need to distinguish execution failures,internal faults, and human errors. The specific problems need to be counted andtracked consistently
Timely defect reporting | Because defect measurements are used to monitor and control software projects, we must ensure timely defect reporting to keep the information current
The exception is | unit testing, which is usually carried out parallel to coding by the same person
Most defects from unit testing are not | formally tracked because they are considered as part of the implementation activities
Defect handling is implicitly assumed to be part of the project  | management activities, which is handled in similar ways as configuration management.
A formalized defect handling process highlights important | activities and associated rules,parties involved, and their responsibilities. 
It is typically defined by the differentstates |  associated with individual defect status and transitions among these states due to status changes
Different defect handling processes may include | different collections of defect status and other possible attributes.
Defect handling is not closely associated with |  defect prevention.
The focus is not on the discovery of underlying faults that cause | failures and possible accidents
Defect information can be used | as additional input
Among the different QA activities, defect containment activities play | an important role in post-release product operations and maintenance support
Repeated use of recovery blocks for the same situations may be an | indication of software problems instead of 
Most of the implementation activities need to be carried out | during software development, not after product release...
including defect prevention and defect reduction, are performed | during software development instead of during in-field software support after
A typical sequence includes, in chronological order: | product planning, requirement analysis,specification, design, coding, testing, release...
The error sources are typically associated with activities in these early phases, such as  | conceptual mistakes by designers and programmers,unfamiliarity with the product domain...
The vast majority of faults are  | injected in the early development phases, particularly in detailed design and implementation phases
failure prevention and containment activities, such as fault tolerance and safety assurance, | are typically the focus of operational phases
QA activities, typically inspections and reviews, carried out at the transitions | from one phase to the next are shown as barriers or gates to pass. 
The exception to this is between testing and release, where | the reviews are typically accompanied by acceptance testing
The general distribution scope is |shown by the dotted bracket, with a focus on defect prevention in the early phases, a focus on defect removal during coding and testing phases...
the overall process can be viewed as consisting of several | increments or iterations
integration testing plays a very important role, to make sure that | different parts can inter-operate seamlessly to fulfill the intended functionalities correctly together
System testing, where the focus is | the overall set of system functions to be provided to users
Usage-based statistical testing, where | the operational environment by target users is simulated during software testing before product release
Software fault tolerance, which focuses on | providing continued service expected by customers even when local problems exist
Software safety assurance activities, which focus on | providing the expected accidentfree operations or reducing accident damage when an accident is unavoidable
Software verification activities check | the conformance of a software system to its specifications
A deviation from the specification is either a fault or a failure, depending on | whether the behavior is specified or other software related entities are specific
failures are involved in verification activities, we are typically dealing with | internal system failures and overall system failures in the form of incorrect behavior
When a function or feature expected by the customers is present, the activity to determine | whether it performs or behaves expectedly is then a verification activity
When we are checking non-behavioral specifications, non-conformance indicates | the presence of faults or errors
Validation checks the conformance to quality expectations of customers and users in | the form of whether the expected functions or features are present or not
verification checks the conformance of software product implementation | against its specifications to see if it is implemented correctly
validation deals directly with users and their requirements  while | verification deals with internal product specifications
verification and validation activities may be distributed in | these different processes differently
A set of internal specifications needs to be | followed or other rules or criteria need to be satisfied
The satisfactory conformance of these specifications, designs, and rules is | the focus of various verification activities
various defect prevention activities are typically | concentrated in the earlier phases of software developmen
defect reduction is typically concentrated in | the middle to late phases of software developmen
defect containment activities are typically the focus of | operational phases, with its planning, design, and implementation carried out earlier during software development
Many specific QA activities deal with both |the verification and the validation aspects.
Defect prevention deals with error source elimination and error blocking, | while both verification and validation deal with failures and faults
The formal verification part naturally falls into verification activities, |verifying the program or design correctness with respect to its formal specifications 
fault tolerance and safety assurance, are more closely related to | validation activities than verification ...
